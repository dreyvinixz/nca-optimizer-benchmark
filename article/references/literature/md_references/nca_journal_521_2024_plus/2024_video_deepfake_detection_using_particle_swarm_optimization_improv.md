Abstract
As complexity and capabilities of Artiﬁcial Intelligence technologies increase, so does its potential for misuse. Deepfake
videos are an example. They are created with generative models which produce media that replicates the voices and faces
of real people. Deepfake videos may be entertaining, but they may also put privacy and security at risk. A criminal may
forge a video of a politician or another notable person in order to affect public opinions or deceive others. Approaches for
detecting and protecting against these types of forgery must evolve as well as the methods of generation to ensure that
proper information is supplied and to mitigate the risks associated with the fast evolution of deepfakes. This research
exploits the effectiveness of deepfake detection algorithms with the application of a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
variant for hyperparameter selection. Since Convolutional Neural Networks excel in recognizing objects and patterns in
visual data while Recurrent Neural Networks are proﬁcient at handling sequential data, in this research, we propose a
hybrid EfﬁcientNet-Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network as well as EfﬁcientNet-B0-based transfer learning for video
forgery classiﬁcation. A new PSO algorithm is proposed for hyperparameter search, which incorporates composite leaders
and reinforcement learning-based search strategy allocation to mitigate premature convergence. To assess whether an
image or a video is manipulated, both models are trained on datasets containing deepfake and genuine photographs and
videos. The empirical results indicate that the proposed PSO-based EfﬁcientNet-GRU and EfﬁcientNet-B0 networks
outperform the counterparts with manual and optimal learning conﬁgurations yielded by other search methods for several
deepfake datasets.

1 Introduction
Generative models are increasingly used. They have
demonstrated a great deal of success in generating high-
quality fake photographs, videos and audios, which may
frequently be impossible to be distinguished from the
genuine ones. The Internet makes it possible for anybody to
create this type of media. The use of deep learning algo-
rithms to the production of this form of content is a sig-
niﬁcant contributor to the development of the notion
known as ‘‘deepfake‘‘. A person with malicious intentions
is able to create real-time video deepfakes using the tools
that are currently available. Such video manipulations
involve the replacement of a source individual with a target
individual using a series of techniques such as face swap-
ping or lip synchronization to generate an entirely new
video.
As continuous advancement in deep generative models,
it is getting increasingly difﬁcult to distinguish between
authentic and fraudulent photographs and videos. In a
study, Nightingale et al. [1] have proved, in two different
trials, that people’s capacity to discern edited photographs
of real-world settings is severely restricted. Their results
suggested concern about the degree to which individuals
may be misled in their day-to-day lives. According to the
authors, this was supported by the fact that manipulated
images already command a signiﬁcant amount of attention
in the media, e.g. social networking sites. Additionally, the
researchers were unable to ﬁnd any convincing evidence to
support the idea that personal characteristics, such as skills

in photography or opinions regarding the degree to which
image manipulation is pervasive in society, are linked to a
better ability to spot or locate manipulations. This was one
of our primary motivations when conducting this study.
The primary means for video and image forgery gen-
eration are through the training of generative models using
variational autoencoders (VAE), Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) or various blends of these two types of
models with other image processing techniques. The
majority of the models will base their networks on Con-
volutional Neural Networks (CNNs), or, beginning in 2022,
more modern models are also capable of using Vision
Transformers (ViT).
Some of the newest generation of models are able to
produce images with a very subtle level of artefacts. As a
result, as pointed out by Sabir et al. [2], the only way to
determine whether or not a face is real or fake is by looking
for features such as an unnaturally asymmetric face, weird
teeth and other more obvious inconsistencies not localized
on the face but in the background. We introduce different
types of attacks as follows.
Face Swapping: The face of a source individual in a
video is changed to match the form and characteristics of
that of a target individual [3]. After having the face of the
target individual initially extracted from an image, it is then
subsequently transferred to a newly generated image or
video. In order to produce the manipulated image, the
process typically involves training two encoders on both
the source image and the target image and then switching
the decoders in order to rebuild the face from image A onto
image B. Some applications have gained popularity due to
the ease with which they can be deployed and the results
they produce. These applications enable even people with
little knowledge to create fake images. Natsume et al. [4]
proposed an region-separative GAN (RSGAN) model for
the generation of synthetic images independently for faces
and hair, which led to improved outcomes on face
swapping.
Facial Reenactment: The facial reenactment techniques
change or reconstruct particular aspects of a face, such as
one’s head position, expression, eye gaze or lip movement.
GAN is the most adopted facial reenactment image gen-
erator. In 2016, Thies et al. [5] developed one of the ﬁrst
tools, namely Face2Face, for facial reenactment. It was a
real-time system that created a 3D face model based on the
input image and used its 3D geometry to render the fake
face. Face2Face was one of the ﬁrst tools of its kind.
Reenactment can also be carried out using purely one video
input with the use of a method proposed by [6]. Speciﬁ-
cally, the head movement, facial expression, eye gazing
and blinking of the eyes were collected initially and then
transferred to a target actor who was also using a 3D head
model. The detection and classiﬁcation of face swapping
and facial reenactment are the primary focuses of this
research.
Due to the gravity of the problem and the possible
danger that deepfakes pose to social stability, there has
been an increase in research aimed at ﬁnding a solution to
the challenge of identifying deepfakes. Constructing a
CNN speciﬁcally tailored to the problem at hand, in this
instance, detecting deepfakes, is one approach that may be
used. But even so, there are a variety of channels that might
be explored. For instance, some may choose from a variety
of network designs, while others may customize a number
of hyperparameters in accordance with speciﬁc tasks. In
addition, there are several studies adopting algorithms to
handle the processing of an image or a video. An algorithm
may, for instance, take into account individual video
frames and attempt to locate instances of spatial inconsis-
tency. Alternatively, the algorithm may compare succes-
sive video frames in an effort to identify instances of
temporal inconsistency.
In this research, we propose transfer learning of CNNs
and hybrid CNN-Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models
with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based hyperpa-
rameter selection for deepfake detection. Our system
comprises three key steps. (1) Firstly a data preprocessing
procedure is applied to crop facial regions to eliminate
background distraction. The cropped facial regions are then
used as inputs to deep networks for video classiﬁcation. (2)
Speciﬁcally, an ImageNet pretrained EfﬁcientNet is ﬁne-
tuned using the deepfake datasets with video frames as
inputs, while EfﬁcientNet serialized with a Gated Recur-
rent Unit (GRU) network is used with videos as inputs
directly for synthetic video classiﬁcation. During the
training stage, a new PSO algorithm is proposed to conduct
optimal hyperparameter search for EfﬁcientNet and Efﬁ-
cientNet-GRU, which integrates composite leader signal
generation and reinforcement learning-based search oper-
ation deployment to increase search ﬂexibility. (3) Finally,
the yielded optimized settings are used to establish the ﬁnal
transfer learning and hybrid networks for fake/real video
classiﬁcation. The research novelties are elaborated as
follows.

performance. The new PSO algorithm combines adap-
tive nonlinear functions for composite leader generation
as well as the Q-learning algorithm for optimal dispatch
of different search operations, to overcome local optima
traps. Evaluated using several well-known deepfake
datasets, the proposed PSO-based EfﬁcientNet-B0 and
EfﬁcientNet-GRU networks achieve superior perfor-
mance over those of existing state-of-the-art methods
for video authenticity identiﬁcation. The proposed
optimizer also shows statistical superiority over other
search methods in solving a variety of unimodal and
multimodal benchmark functions.

In this section, we discuss state-of-the-art deep neural
networks for deepfake detection and swarm intelligence
algorithms for optimal hyperparameter ﬁne-tuning.
2.1 Deepfake detection
One of the ﬁrst end-to-end trainable architectures for video
classiﬁcation using CNN and RNN was proposed in 2015
by Liang and Hu [7]. Their work exploited recurrent CNN
(RCNN) for undertaking object recognition. In 2016,
Donahue et al. [8] studied Long-Term Recurrent Convo-
lutional Network (LRCN), where a CNN processed raw
visual input and fed it to a stack of recurrent sequential
models for spatial–temporal feature extraction. Speciﬁ-
cally, the LRCN model adopted CNNs to learn visual
features from video frames and passed a sequence of image
embeddings through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks for video classiﬁcation.
In 2018, after the ﬁrst deepfakes appeared, the idea to
use the hybrid architecture for deepfake detection was ﬁrst
researched and published combining the advantageous
characteristics of the RNN to enhance the performance of
the CNN. According to Sabir et al. [2], the body of liter-
ature that has been most explored to gain insight about
video classiﬁcation for deep fake detection was video
action recognition [9–12] because of the extensive devel-
opment in the ﬁeld in recent years and similar spatial–
temporal processing nature to that of deepfake detection.
One of the main methods of human action recognition is a
‘‘two-stream’’ network methodology, which processes
video frames and optical ﬂow in two different branches
before fusing them for video classiﬁcation. [13] presented a
deepfake detection with this two-stream technique. In
addition, an RCNN model was employed by [2] for deep-
fake detection. It processed each frame using a CNN, and
the extracted spatial features were further processed using
an RNN for video forgery identiﬁcation. Other strategies
utilized biological signals and attention layers [14, 15] to
enhance the efﬁciency for manipulated video detection. In
particular, these techniques paid special attention to lip
movements and eye gaze to check for inconsistencies.
Moreover, Sabir et al. [2] focused on using a CNN
followed by a recurrent model with the input as the query
video frame sequences. Their model exploited frame-to-
frame temporal differences. Their work claimed that since
image manipulations were conducted frame-by-frame and
temporal discrepancies were expected, low-level face
manipulation techniques should show temporal artefacts
with inconsistent features across frames. Their work thus
aimed to identify such temporal inconsistencies. Speciﬁ-
cally, they used a DenseNet to extract features like dis-
continuous jawlines and blurred eyes and then retrieved the
RNN’s ﬁnal output rather than averaging recurrent features
across all time steps as in traditional video classiﬁcation
pipelines.
2.2 Hyperparameter search
Hyperparameter conﬁgurations of deep neural networks
have signiﬁcant effects in reducing or preventing oscilla-
tions in gradient descents as well as correcting gradient
directions for weight adjustment towards global optima.
The local optima, plateau and saddle points in the loss
space are the major challenges that deep networks
encounter. If hyperparameters of deep neural networks are
not appropriately optimized, the networks’ performance
will be affected
signiﬁcantly by the above factors.
Although methods, such as grid and random search, work
well for hyperparameter search with discrete values in a
small search space, there are other more effective methods
like employing swarm-based metaheuristic methods to
determine optimal hyperparameter conﬁgurations specially
in a continuous large search space like loss spaces in deep
networks. We explore such an option through an evolu-
tionary algorithm called PSO, which is simple to imple-
ment and has been proven by the literature to produce great
robustness for learning conﬁguration selection in neural
networks.
The evolutionary algorithms are optimization methods
that take inspiration from biological processes. The PSO
algorithm was proposed by [16] in 1995, which takes
inspiration from ﬁsh or bird swarm movement.
Because PSO does not rely on gradient descent, one can
use an objective function to optimize deep network
parameters without relying on its derivatives [9]. In this
work, hyperparameters of deep learning models such as the
learning rate, dropout rate, image input size and number of
frames extracted from videos will be optimized. The
objective function will be associated with loss function of

the deep learning model to advise search of optimal
learning settings.
The way PSO works is by initializing a group of parti-
cles in the search space of the function randomly, and at
each iteration it checks which particle achieves the lowest
value (i.e. the most optimal loss) on the objective function.
At each following step, each particle uses the information
of the best solutions found by the swarm and itself, along
with random exploration factors, to guide the particle’s
movement [16].
Taking k as the iteration number, the velocity of a given
particle i is given by:
viðk þ 1Þ ¼ wviðkÞ þ c1r1ðxpbest
i
ðkÞ  xiðkÞÞ
þ c2r2ðgbestðkÞ  xiðkÞÞ
ð1Þ
where
–
viðkÞ is the velocity of particle i at iteration k;
–
w is an inertia weight;
–
c1 and c2 are parameters called the ‘‘cognitive‘‘ and
‘‘social’’ coefﬁcients, respectively;
–
r1 and r2 are randomly generated numbers between 0
and 1;
–
pbest is the ‘‘personal best‘‘ position of the particle (i.e.
the best position it has achieved so far);
–
gbest is the ‘‘global best’’ position among all particles
in the swarm (i.e. the best position achieved by the
swarm);
The position of the particle i at iteration k þ 1 will be
updated with the velocity as follows:
xiðk þ 1Þ ¼ xiðkÞ þ viðk þ 1Þ
ð2Þ
The inertia weight controls how much of the particle’s
previous velocity is kept in the update. A greater w setting
indicates that the particle’s previous velocity has strong
effects to the new velocity generation. The cognitive and
social weights deﬁne how much the particle is impacted by
its own best past experiences (pbest) and the best experi-
ences of the other particles in the swarm (gbest), respec-
tively [17]. In general, the values of c1 and c2 should be
greater than 0, and less than or equivalent to 2.5. Setting
these values too low may lead the particles to fail to suf-
ﬁciently explore the search space, whereas setting them too
high may cause the particles to become extremely sensitive
to changes in the swarm and exhibit suboptimal behaviour.
In short, PSO is a powerful optimization technique that
has been used to solve a wide range of optimization
problems. The velocity update formula is critical in
establishing how the swarm particles move and update
their positions in search of a satisfactory optimal solution.
Variant methods have also been proposed to tackle local
optima traps of the original PSO algorithm, which were
widely adopted in hyperparameter and architecture search
in deep networks [18–20].
There are inspiring related studies for hyperparameter
and architecture search using multi-task learning. For
example, automatic generation of multi-task learning
models was conducted by Zhang et al. [21] for solving a
variety of semantic segmentation problems. The automa-
tion process utilized a randomly assigned backbone net-
work in conjunction with a set of tasks as inputs with the
attempt to generate a multi-task model with a reasonable
trade-off between performance and cost. A gradient-based
search method was used for architecture search. The opti-
mization process determined the assignment of different
network nodes for each task and how these selected nodes
were shared with other tasks. A unique characteristic of
their work was the adoption of parameter sharing at the
operator (neuron) level via a joint optimization of shared
policies and network weights. Their yielded multi-task
model showed great capabilities in tackling diverse multi-
class semantic segmentation problems. In addition, auto-
mated production of search parameter and search mecha-
nisms for metaheuristic algorithms was exploited by
Stu¨tzle and Lo´pez-Iba´n˜ez [22]. Such techniques were
capable of developing optimizers with effective new search
strategies. They also showed great efﬁciency in enhancing
existing search methods’ performance via optimal param-
eter selection. Furthermore, an adaptive hybridized multi-
task learning framework was developed by Lialestani et al.
[23] pertaining to temperature prediction at different depth
levels. Their work performed architecture generation of a
multi-task multilayer perceptron neural network using a FA
variant developed by Shahri et al. [24]. The FA variant
conducted multi-task network architecture generation,
where the absorption and randomization parameters were
ﬁne-tuned by the population brightness variance.
Cheng et al. [25] developed a multi-task learning model
with a hybrid CNN-transformer encoder for simultaneous
image segmentation and classiﬁcation using multimodal
MRI image inputs. A U-Net-like encoder-decoder archi-
tecture was proposed with an additional transformer unit
embedded in the bottom of the CNN-based encoder. The
hybrid CNN-transformer encoder fused high-level spatial
and global features extracted by a CNN-stream and a
transformer-based operation, respectively. The joint learn-
ing of both segmentation and classiﬁcation tasks was
conducted via a compound loss function integrating seg-
mentation and classiﬁcation losses with uncertain weights.
To tackle data sparsity and unlabelled data, a semi-super-
vised joint learning mechanism was deployed to enhance
classiﬁcation performance by integrating with uncertainty-
based label selection.

2.3 Other Swarm intelligence algorithms
Besides PSO, in recent years, a number of new state-of-the-
art swarm intelligence algorithms have been proposed
including Spotted Hyena Optimizer, Symbiotic Organisms
Search, Tree Seed Algorithm, Sparrow Search Algorithm
and Tunicate Swarm Algorithm, for tackling engineering,
mathematics and image processing optimization problems.
Proposed by Cheng and Prayogo [26], Symbiotic Organ-
isms Search employs mutualism, commensalism and par-
asitism processes to simulate mutual interaction of two
organisms to lead the search of global optimality. Firstly,
during mutualism, the mean position vector of the current
search agent and another randomly selected organism is
calculated, which is used in conjunction with the global
best solution to update the positions of both the current and
randomly selected individuals. Their offspring solutions
are used to replace them if the new solutions are ﬁtter.
Secondly, for the commensalism stage, the difference
between the global best solution and a randomly selected
individual is used to guide the movement of the current
search agent. Subsequently, the parasitism operation ran-
domly mutates the dimensions of the current search agent,
which is used to substitute a randomly selected organism if
this mutated solution is ﬁtter. The effectiveness of Sym-
biotic Organisms Search was evidenced by its capabilities
in handling diverse engineering and benchmark optimiza-
tion problems, as indicated in a related study [27]. Modi-
ﬁed Symbiotic Organisms Search algorithms and its
hybridation with other search methods were also exten-
sively studied in [27] to guide future development. Moti-
vated by the cluster hunting behaviours of the spotted
hyenas, the search process of Spotted Hyena Optimizer
[28] comprises encircling/hunting and attack mechanisms.
The encircling/hunting operation performs local exploita-
tion and intensiﬁes the search around the global best
solution. Speciﬁcally, the leader spotted hyena with the
best ﬁtness score is used to re-allocate the remaining
spotted hyenas to its optimal neighbouring regions. Those
spotted hyenas with high correlations to the leader form a
cluster where their mean position is used to generate a new
swarm leader. Adaptive search coefﬁcients are exploited to
balance local and global search operations. Diverse Spotted
Hyena Optimizer variant methods including the integration
with other swarm intelligence algorithms such as PSO and
Simulated Annealing (SA) as well as other local/global
search strategies were extensively studied in Ghafori and
Gharehchopogh
[29].
Their
ﬂexibilities
were
further
demonstrated in solving a variety of complex single and
multi-objective optimization problems [29].
A Sparrow Search Algorithm was developed by Xue and
Shen [30] where the population was composed of top
ranking producer and lower ranking scrounger subswarms.
In addition, 10%-20% of the sparrows are capable of per-
ceiving danger. The top ranking producers perform global
exploration when a randomly generated alarm coefﬁcient is
lower than the pre-deﬁned safety threshold, otherwise the
producer subswarm conducts local exploitation using
Gaussian distribution. The lower ranking scrounger sub-
swarm is guided by the producers to exploit optimal local
regions of the respective producers. The sparrows with the
capabilities of sensing danger follow the swarm leader
while staying away from the global worst solution. The
algorithm outperformed other classical search methods for
solving a number of numerical optimization problems. To
overcome slow convergence of the model, a number of
variant methods of the Sparrow Search Algorithm were
studied by Gharehchopogh et al. [31]. These include the
incorporation of PSO, Fireﬂy Algorithm (FA) [32], Dif-
ferential Evolution (DE) and Since Cosine Algorithm
(SCA) [33] with Sparrow Search Algorithm, respectively.
Other enhancement mechanisms such as random walk
based on Levy ﬂights and chaotic map-based swarm ini-
tialization are also exploited to increase search robustness.
Related studies of neural architecture and hyperparameter
search using the Sparrow Search Algorithm were also
investigated in [31]. A Tree Seed Algorithm was exploited
by Kiran [34]. A swarm of tree solutions is randomly ini-
tialized. For each tree, a number of seed solutions are
generated. Speciﬁcally, each new seed solution is gener-
ated using two sub-dimension-based search operations.
One is guided by the best tree solution and a randomly
selected tree position while the other is led by the current
tree position and a randomly selected tree location. For the
generation of a speciﬁc dimension of a seed solution, the
selection of these two search strategies is controlled by a
randomly generated threshold parameter. The number of
the new seed solutions that can be produced for each tree is
dynamic between 10% and 25% of the population size, in
order to increase search exploitation. If the best offspring
seed solution is ﬁtter than the tree solution, it is used to
substitute the tree solution. The algorithm obtained com-
petitive performance in comparison with other search
methods such as PSO and FA for solving 24 numerical test
functions. A comprehensive survey of the Tree Seed
Algorithm was conducted by [35] where a variety of
variants of Tree Seed Algorithm were analysed. The vari-
ant methods included the combination of Tree Seed
Algorithm with other swarm intelligence algorithms such
as Artiﬁcial Bee Colony (ABC) [36] and SCA. Improve-
ment strategies such as Levy and Gaussian distributions
were also utilized to enhance ﬂexibility of Tree Seed
Algorithm. Moreover, the effectiveness of Tree Seed
Algorithm was also ascertained by handling a variety of
real-world optimization problems such as feature selection

and image compression. A variant method of Tunicate
Swarm Algorithm was studied by Gharehchopogh [37],
which included Quantum Rotation Gate (QRG) and
mutation operators based on Cauchy, Gaussian and Levy
distributions to increase search robustness of the original
method. In particular, besides using QRG, their work
explored the effectiveness of the combinations of any two
out of the three mutation operators as well as the integra-
tion of all three random walk strategies. The superiority of
the full model integrating all mutation operators along with
QRG was ascertained by solving a set of 52 unimodal,
multimodal, composition and hybrid test functions, as well
as several other engineering optimization problems.
A new FA variant was developed by Shahri et al. [24] by
incorporating a brightness expectation value and a gener-
alized weighted average of a random brightness. It
exploited an adaptive absorption coefﬁcient and an adap-
tive randomization search step to better balance the search
between intensiﬁcation and diversiﬁcation. The population
ﬁtness variance was used to adjust these adaptive search
parameters after a number of iterations, which was calcu-
lated using the difference between the ﬁtness of each ﬁreﬂy
and the mean ﬁtness of the overall swarm, divided by a
dynamic normalization factor. Owing to the adaptive
adjustment of the search parameters based on the ﬁtness
variations during the search process, their method showed
better capabilities in overcoming local optima traps in
comparison with FA for solving several benchmark func-
tions as well as multi-objective blasting engineering
problems.
Motivated by foraging behaviours of social spiders,
Social Spider Optimizer (SSO) [38] ﬁrst generates a
vibration intensity of each spider whereby a better ﬁtness
score aligns with a stronger vibration. The strongest
vibration intensity generated by other spiders and sensed
by the current spider is extracted. A randomly generated
binary mask is used to select either this new best vibration
intensity or another vibration intensity generated by a
random individual in each dimension for the construction
of new personal leader signal. This new elite leader signal
is used to guide a random walk operation for position
updating. Boundary checkings are also performed after
position updates. SSO shows competitive performance as
compared with a number of state-of-the-art search algo-
rithms for tackling diverse numerical optimization prob-
lems. Besides the above, there are also other swarm
intelligence algorithms developed for handling feature
selection, hyperparameter search, deep neural architecture
generation with respect to image segmentation/classiﬁca-
tion [19, 39–41], human action recognition [42] and envi-
ronmental sound classiﬁcation [18], as well as solving
other engineering and mathematical optimization problems
[43–49].
3 The proposed methods for deepfake
detection
The proposed deepfake detection system consists of three
key steps, i.e. (1) data preprocessing for the extraction of
cropped facial regions, (2) the proposed PSO-based
hyperparameter optimization during network training stage
and (3) model establishment using the selected optimal
settings and subsequent evaluation using unseen test sam-
ples. In particular, transfer learning with EfﬁcientNet as the
backbone as well as a hybrid EfﬁcientNet-GRU model is
studied in conjunction with PSO-based hyperparameter
search for synthetic video classiﬁcation. We introduce each
key stage below.
3.1 Data preprocessing
The initial stage of the training pipeline involves extracting
and pre-processing the ﬁrst 150 frames of each video. The
Python OpenCV library was used to extract the image
frames, and then, the faces on each frame were processed
through the Multi-task cascaded CNN (MTCNN) face
detector [50] for cropping. After that, the face crops were
organized into folders and saved as image ﬁles within the
ﬁle system. In particular, the cropped facial regions from
the real videos are augmented during training by ﬂipping
them horizontally to increase real sample sizes. Figure 1
shows
the
detailed
preprocessing
pipeline
for
face
cropping.
Proposed by Zhang et al. [50], the MTCNN model is
used for face detection. Speciﬁcally, the model is able to
perform face classiﬁcation, facial region bounding box
generation and facial alignment. MTCNN ﬁrstly deploys a
proposal CNN to perform binary (face and non-face)
classiﬁcation and generate a number of candidate bounding
box regression vectors. The nonmaximum suppression
(NMS) method is used to merge highly overlapped
bounding boxes. A second CNN model is subsequently
utilized to further reﬁne the bounding box regression
results by rejecting remaining candidate false positives. A
third comparatively deeper CNN is used in this stage to
determine the ﬁnal bounding box output as well as generate
a set of facial landmarks indicating positions of both eye
centres, left and right mouth corners and the nose tip. The
MTCNN model outperformed other face detection bench-
marks while maintaining efﬁcient computational cost.
In this research, we employ MTCNN to perform real-
time facial bounding box regression for all sampled frames
extracted from the video, without using associated facial
landmark outputs. The detected facial regions determined
by the bounding box regression vectors are cropped out for
subsequent classiﬁcation. Owing to the fact that a region of

interest containing the entire face is tracked through the
overall video using bounding boxes, the false positives of
face classiﬁcation and localization are greatly reduced.
This in turn signiﬁcantly improves real and manipulated
video classiﬁcation performance. Figure 2 shows the
results for face detection and cropping for a sample video.
We use two well-known video deepfake datasets, i.e.
Celeb-DFv2 and DFDC, for model evaluation. Precisely,
the Celeb-DFv2 dataset [51] consists of 590 genuine and
5,639 fake videos. The ofﬁcial split of the dataset shows
5,711 and 518 videos for training/validation and test,
respectively. We adopt this ofﬁcial split in our experiment.
The DFDC dataset [52] has a total of 23,654 real and
104,500 synthetic videos. We extract a subset of 1,016
original and 8,425 tampered videos in our experiments. A
test set of 206 real and 1,636 fake videos is used for testing
with the remaining videos for training and validation in our
experiment. We further split the training and validation sets
using a ratio of 80-20.
Besides the evaluation of each of the above datasets, we
also generate a customized dataset by combining the above
two datasets with a video face recognition database, i.e.
YouTube Faces Database [53], for model evaluation. The
YouTube Faces Database is designed for video face
recognition and consists of 3,425 videos from 1,595 sub-
jects, with an average of 181.3 frames per video. It is used
to increase the genuine video sample sizes to balance the
large numbers of fake instances provided by Celeb-DFv2
and DFDC. To be speciﬁc, at the training stage, all real
videos from the ofﬁcial training set in Celeb-DFv2, a
comparatively larger number of real videos from DFDC, as
well as 1,618 videos from the Youtube Faces Database
with more than 50 frames, were combined together to
construct the customized genuine training video set. In
addition, a balanced number of fake videos are drawn from
the ofﬁcial training set of Celeb-DFv2 and our DFDC
subset in order to obtain a ratio of approximately 50%-50%
between fake and real videos, in the constructed training
set. We further split the combined training set by a ratio of
80-20 for training and validation, respectively. The real and
fake samples from the ofﬁcial test set of Celeb-DFv2 and a
comparatively larger DFDC unseen test set are used for
model evaluation in this experiment.
Table 1 shows the detailed training/validation and test
sample sizes for each dataset.
The ﬁnal step was to send the data to the Pytorch dat-
aloader so that the models could be trained and validated
for each experimental setting. During the training process,
the transformations serve to supplement the data by
changing each frame from real videos at each epoch with a

random component. This is accomplished through the use
of augmentation. For the training dataset, we initially used
random rotation with 20 degrees and gaussian blur. The
images were initially resized and then normalized before
being used in either the training/validation sets or the test
set. For the oversampling of frames from real videos, the
RandomHorizontalFlip() function is utilized.
3.2 Model 1—transfer learning using CNN
We ﬁrstly employ transfer learning using a CNN model
with the EfﬁcientNet architecture for deepfake detection.
Figure 3 shows the overall dataﬂow using transfer learning
for synthetic video classiﬁcation.
EfﬁcientNet was designed with the goal of scaling
CNNs more efﬁciently than other deep networks proposed
previously [54]. Since its inception, this CNN architecture
has shown to be among those that achieve the highest
performance when tested against various image classiﬁca-
tion benchmarks.
EfﬁcientNet makes use of a compound scaling strategy,
which involves scaling the network’s width, resolution and
depth uniformly to whatever degree is required to make
optimal use of the computational resources available. A
grid search is usually used to ﬁnd the scaling constants
[54].
The network design of EfﬁcientNet makes use of mobile
inverted bottleneck convolution (MBConv), which is
analogous to MobileNetV2 convolutional block but slightly
larger. In order to maximize precision and FLOPS, a neural
architecture search was employed in the construction of the
baseline model. After that, a family of EfﬁcientNet models
was obtained by scaling it up using such a strategy. Within
the context of this research, the version known as Efﬁ-
cientNet-B0 was employed [54]. The overall architecture
speciﬁcally used in this study including the fully connected
layers is shown in Table 2 below. The pure EfﬁcientNet
was also used by the winning solution of the Deepfake
Detection Tournament hosted by the DFDC dataset authors
in 2019 [52].
The MBConv blocks consist of residual blocks like
ResNet that connect the beginning of the block with the
end using a skip connection. The difference from the
original block from ResNet is that, regarding the number of
channels,
it
follows
a
narrow-wide-narrow
approach
instead of the traditional wide-narrow-wide strategy [54].
The EfﬁcientNet-B0 model was initially trained using
ImageNet. We further ﬁne-tune the model using the
training/validation sets of the frames of each deepfake
dataset in our experiments. The ﬁne-tuned model is used
for the identiﬁcation of fake/real videos. In addition, a new
PSO variant is used to ﬁne-tune network hyperparameter,
i.e. learning rate, dropout rate, image size and number of
frames, with the attempt to further enhance performance.
Speciﬁcally, a random swarm is ﬁrstly initialized in a
search space of [0, 1]. Each particle has four dimensions to
represent the four optimized hyperparameters. The pro-
posed PSO search operations are used to guide the particle
movement in the search space for hyperparameter search.
We evaluate each particle’s ﬁtness by converting its posi-
tion into valid network learning conﬁgurations, which are
used to set up transfer learning process. The network per-
formance on the validation set is used as the ﬁtness mea-
sure of each particle. The most optimal solution identiﬁed
by the proposed optimizer is used as the recommended best
learning conﬁgurations of EfﬁcientNet-B0. The optimized
EfﬁcientNet-B0 model is then trained using the combined
training set with larger numbers of epochs and tested with
the respective test sets for deepfake detection.

3.3 Model 2—hybrid CNN-RNN
Besides using transfer learning for video forgery detection,
motivated by [2, 55–57], a hybrid CNN-RNN architecture
is proposed in this research for distinguishing fake from
real videos. Speciﬁcally, this hybrid model uses Efﬁ-
cientNet serialized with a GRU layer for spatial–temporal
feature extraction to inform video classiﬁcation. The pro-
posed PSO algorithm is used for identifying optimal
hyperparameters. Figure 4 shows the system dataﬂow. The
detailed network architecture is shown in Table 3.
As shown in Table 3, a latent representation of 1,280
dimension output extracted from the last convolutional
layer of EfﬁcientNet is taken as input from each frame and
these features of each frame are concatenated to be passed
on to the GRU layer. The GRU layer is used to take
advantage of the spatial temporal features from the
sequence of frames verifying if it is either a deepfake or a
real video. The process is different from the pure CNN (i.e.
the aforementioned EfﬁcientNet) that takes the average of
all frames for deepfake detection as in the transfer learning
process. The GRU component has thus 1,280 latent
dimensions and 1,280 hidden layers as the layer conﬁgu-
rations in this study.
The optimizer used is ADAM that combines features of
optimization algorithms such as RMSProp and ADAGrad.
It is used to adjust the learning rate for each weight on the
ﬂy using exponential weighted moving average to get the
ﬁrst and second moments of the gradient estimates [56].
The loss function opted is cross-entropy loss. It gives two
likelihoods for real and fake labels using a softmax func-
tion [56]. In addition, to improve discriminative feature
learning, we ﬁne-tune the weights of ImageNet pre-trained
EfﬁcientNet-B0 embedded in the proposed EfﬁcientNet-

GRU model using the combined training set with a small
number of epochs (i.e. 5 epochs), before passing on fea-
tures to the GRU layer. Moreover, the proposed PSO model
is used to ﬁne-tune hyperparameters of this hybrid network
during the training stage, similar to the process discussed
earlier
for parameter search using transfer learning.
Speciﬁcally, we optimize the learning rate, dropout rate,
image size and number of video frames, owing to their
signiﬁcance to network performance.
3.4 The proposed PSO model
for hyperparameter optimization
A new PSO variant is proposed for hyperparameter search
for both EfﬁcientNet-GRU and EfﬁcientNet-B0 in this
research. In order to tackle limitations of the original PSO
algorithm, it incorporates nonlinear functions for compos-
ite leader generation and a reinforcement learning strategy
for dynamically adjusting the search process. As such,
different search actions led by different hybrid leaders and
the global best solution are dynamically dispatched based
on the reward schemes of the reinforcement learning
algorithm. Figure 5 shows the overall proposed algorithm.
The detailed search strategies are presented below.
3.4.1 Composite leader generation
As indicated in existing studies, the original PSO model is
likely to be trapped in local optima because of the adoption
of a single swarm leader to lead the search process.
Therefore, composite leaders are produced by incorporat-
ing the global best solution and a distant second leader
based on the adaptive weighting factors generated using
nonlinear formulae. Equation 3 shows the operation for
composite leader generation, where the remote second
leader, sbest, is obtained by selecting the most distant
particle to the swarm leader among the top 5 ranking
solutions.
compositeðkÞ ¼ wa  gbestðkÞ þ wb  sbestðkÞ
ð3Þ
where wa and wb are the adaptive weighting factors which
are used to weigh the effects of the swarm leader and the
second leader for composite signal generation. Two sets of
nonlinear functions are introduced for weighting coefﬁ-
cient generation.
Equations 4–6 deﬁne the ﬁrst set of formulae for adap-
tive weighting coefﬁcient production.

where u = [0:0.001:p] with x and y denoting the coordi-

generate increasing and decreasing subgraphs, as shown in
blue and orange lines, respectively, in Fig. 6. Each com-
prises 1571 unique 2D points. We subsequently extract
maximum iteration number of values from 1571 unique y-
axis values in the increasing branch with an interval of
i
maximum
iteration. These extracted increasing values are used
as the weighting factor wa for the swarm leader. Similarly,
maximum iteration number of values are also extracted
from 1571 unique y-axis values in the decreasing subgraph
with an interval of
i
maximum
iteration. They are subsequently

assigned to the weighting coefﬁcient wb for the second
leader. Each pair of increasing wa and decreasing wb
parameters is utilized for producing a composite leader in
each iteration. The adoption of such increasing and
decreasing coefﬁcients strengthens the effects of the swarm
leader and reduces the inﬂuence of the second leader as
iteration increases. As such, the algorithm encourages
global exploration and intensiﬁes local exploitation at the
beginning and end of the search process, respectively.
Besides the above, another set of adaptive increasing
and decreasing coefﬁcients is also generated using Eq. 7
and Eqs. 5–6, for composite leader generation to increase
search ﬂexibility. The resulting increasing and decreasing
sub-contours deﬁned by Eq. 7 are illustrated in Figure 7
with each containing 1571 unique 2D points. We also
extract maximum iteration number of values from 1571
unique y-axis values in the increasing branch with an
interval of
i
maximum
iteration and assign them as the increasing
weight coefﬁcient wa for the swarm leader. The same
process is also applied to the decreasing sub-contour for the
generation of the weight factor wb for the second leader.
These new sets of wa and wb are then utilized for producing
composite leaders.
The difference between these new sub-contours deﬁned
in Eq. 7 and the subgraphs deﬁned by Eq. 4 is that these
new sub-contours generate larger weighting factors in
comparison with those yielded by the previous subgraphs,
therefore diversifying the production of the combined
leaders.

Each composite leader is then used to replace the global
best solution in Eq. 1 for velocity production with respect
to hyperparameter search, as shown in Eq. 8. Such com-
posite leaders are able to explore the search space more
thoroughly and show enhanced capabilities in tackling
stagnation.

3.4.2 Reinforcement learning-based optimal search action
selection
Owing to the employment of the composite leader gener-
ation process, a total of three search operations led by the
swarm leader and the aforementioned yielded two com-
posite leaders are constructed. A reinforcement learning
algorithm is subsequently used to identify the optimal
selection of different leader signals for hyperparameter
search. Speciﬁcally, in each iteration, each particle is gui-
ded by either a composite leader or the global best solution
recommended by the Q-learning algorithm [58].
The Q-learning algorithm [58] employs a Bellman
equation deﬁned in Eq. 9 to identify a sequence of optimal
search actions. In reinforcement learning, an agent per-
ceives the environment by learning from punishment and
reward signals through trial and error. The ultimate goal of
the reinforcement learning scheme is to yield a set of
optimal search operations that maximize the cumulative
reward. Such an expected cumulative reward score for a
state–action combination denoted as the Q-value is updated
using Eq. 9, in the Q-learning algorithm. These Q-values
are stored in a Q-table pertaining to each state–action pair.

where h is the learning rate and b is the discount coefﬁ-
cient. At each time t, the agent performs an action at in
state st resulting in a new state stþ1. Besides the current Q-
value Qðst; atÞ, the new Q-value, Qnewðst; atÞ, is generated
based on two additional components, i.e. an immediate
reward rt and a future reward maxa Qðstþ1; aÞ. After per-
forming a selected search action at, the network with the
new conﬁguration decoded from the new position is used to
test the sampled validation set of the combined dataset,
whereby the cross-entropy loss of the sampled validation
set is used as the ﬁtness score. If this new ﬁtness score is
better than the previous ﬁtness of the particle, an imme-
diate reward ‘1’ is used for rt, otherwise ‘-1’ is dispatched.
The future reward maxa Qðstþ1; aÞ is produced by identi-
fying the action that leads to the maximum reward in the
new state stþ1.
Each particle constructs a 3-by-3 Q-table with the rows
and columns denoting the states and actions, respectively.
Such a Q-table is used to determine the selection of optimal
search actions led by either any of the composite leaders or
the global best solution. Therefore, in each iteration, each
particle is assigned with different leader signals to increase
search robustness. In comparison with random selection of
the search actions as in most existing PSO variants, the
Q-learning algorithm produces a sequence of optimal
search actions based on the reward principles imposed by
the Bellman equation.
The proposed PSO model equipped with composite
leader generation and Q-learning-based search operation
dispatch shows enhanced search capabilities in tackling
stagnation in our empirical studies. The hyperparameter
search is conducted as follows. Because of the large
training and validation sample sizes of the combined
dataset, subsets of the training and validation sets are
employed for optimal hyperparameter selection. Each ele-
ment of the particle represents a hyperparameter to be
optimized. The optimal hyperparameters recommended by
each particle are used to set up a customized deep network.
It is subsequently trained and evaluated using the sampled
training and validation sets of the combined dataset,
respectively. The cross-entropy loss of the sampled vali-
dation set is used as the ﬁtness score of each particle. The
ﬁnal optimized network is constructed using the conﬁgu-
rations extracted from the global best solution. This ﬁnal
optimized network is trained with a much larger number of
training epochs (i.e. 30 epochs) using the overall training
set of the combined dataset and tested using Celeb-DFv2,
DFDC and combined datasets, respectively. We introduce
evaluation details in the following section.
4 Evaluation and results
We evaluate the transfer learning and hybrid networks with
manual and automatic hyperparameter optimization using
Celeb-DFv2, DFDC and the combined datasets, respec-
tively. Firstly, for the manual and PSO-based parameter
selection, we use the training and validation sets of the
combined dataset, since the combined dataset has a mixed
data source which may lead to better representative capa-
bilities. The optimized learning conﬁgurations are subse-
quently used to set up each model. Each optimized network
is then trained using the combined training set and evalu-
ated using test sets of the Celeb-DFv2, DFDC and com-
bined datasets, respectively. The experimental studies are
elaborated in detail below.
4.1 Manual hyperparameter selection
In the initial experiments, the models were trained with
hyperparameter searched manually. The process entails
individually experimenting with a range of hyperparame-
ters
selected.
The
following
hyperparameters
are
optimized:
•
Learning rate
•
Dropout rate
•
Image Size—The size measured by height x width of
the input image will inﬂuence the result because of the
number of pixels processed by the CNN. The ranges
evaluated are from 100 to 130 pixels because of the
trade-off between performance and cost.
•
Number of Frames per Video—This metric inﬂuences
the result because of the size of the sequence of frames
extracted. The maximum limit considered is 50 frames
because of comparatively smaller or similar maximum
frame settings adopted in existing studies [59–61].
The training and validation sets of the combined dataset are
used for hyperparameter search. For each of the afore-
mentioned hyperparameters, a set of three values was
chosen in order to manually ﬁne-tune the model and
identify the conﬁguration with the lowest loss. The process

was repeated for each one of the four hyperparameters. The
values that composed the set are illustrated in Table 4.
A total of 5 epochs were run to obtain the loss value for
each hyperparameter set, as this was the number of epochs
that demonstrated satisfactory stability in the preliminary
results. To choose the optimal ones in each of them, the
algorithm was run through their possible values, while the
other hyperparameters remained constant. The parameter
setting with the smallest loss error was then selected. These
manually selected optimized settings are used to set up
each network, which is further tested with test sets of
Celeb-DFv2,
DFDC
and
the
combined
datasets,
respectively.
4.1.1 Manual parameter search for EfficientNet-B0
As mentioned above, the training and validation sets of the
combined dataset are used for hyperparameter search. For
the EfﬁcientNet-B0 architecture using transfer learning, the
best hyperparameters obtained through this manual process
are shown in Table 5.
4.1.2 Manual parameter search for EfficientNet-GRU
Similarly, Table 6 comprises the hyperparameters that
were determined to be the most optimal ones for the Efﬁ-
cientNet-GRU architecture for the combined dataset.
Both the EfﬁcientNet and EfﬁcientNet-GRU networks
equipped with manually selected best model conﬁgurations
are subsequently evaluated using test sets of Celeb-DFv2,
DFDC and the combined datasets, respectively. The
detailed evaluation results for both networks with manually
identiﬁed optimal settings are provided in Section 4.2.
We have also carried out experiments to determine the
best search range of the number of frames for automated
hyperparameter search. Existing studies such as Wang
et al. [62] and Zhao et al. [15] employed 30 frames, while
Zheng et al. [59], Shiohara and Yamasaki [60] and Zhao
et al. [61] adopted 32 frames for video inference, for
evaluating several video deepfake datasets, such as Celeb-
DFv2, DFDC and
FaceForensics?? (FF??). These
studies resized the cropped facial images to larger image
resolutions
such
as
224  224,
256  256
and
380  380, in their experiments. We identify the optimal
search range of the frame settings using the combined
training set for model training and the ofﬁcial Celeb-DFv2
test set for model testing. We manually set up the frame
settings in the range of [10, 100], with the following ﬁxed
learning conﬁgurations, i.e. learning rate = 0.0001, dropout
rate = 0.3 and image size = 112, for both EfﬁcientNet-B0
and EfﬁcientNet-GRU. For both long and short videos, the
target number of frames is randomly sampled from each
video. The detailed evaluation results, i.e. accuracy rates
and Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores, are shown in
Tables 7 and 8.
As indicated in Tables 7 and 8, experimental results for
the EfﬁcientNet-B0 model show improvements when the
frame setting increases from 10 to 30 using the Celeb-
DFv2 test set. When further increasing of the number of
frames to 50 above, the training cost increases signiﬁ-
cantly, and the network is increasingly becoming overﬁt-
ting, owing to the capture of irrelevant noise between
frames, lowering its performance as indicated in both
accuracy rates and AUC scores. A similar case is also
observed for the evaluation using EfﬁcientNet-GRU using
the Celeb-DFv2 test set. The model shows enhanced per-
formance when using the frame settings ranging from 10 to

40. When further increasing the frame settings to 50 above,
both accuracy rates and AUC scores are reduced, because
of the extraction of noisy redundant details from video
frames. A similar observation is also obtained when using
the DFDC and combined test sets. Therefore, in order to
generate robust networks and balance well between com-
putational cost and performance, we employ the frame
setting range of [10-50] for automated hyperparameter
search for both networks.
4.2 Automatic hyperparameter search using
the proposed PSO model
Besides
manual
hyperparameter
selection,
automatic
hyperparameter search is also performed. We employ the
proposed PSO model, as well as 8 classical search methods
and 4 PSO variant algorithms, for hyperparameter search,
including PSO, ABC [36], Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA)
[44], SSO [38], Bare-bones PSO (BBPSO) [63], Flower
Pollination Algorithm (FPA) [64], FA [32], Dragonﬂy
Algorithm (DA) [65], Genetic PSO (GPSO) [40], PSO with
sine coefﬁcients (SPSO) [20], a BBPSO variant with
attractiveness and evade actions (BBPSOV) [49] and PSO
with adaptive sine, circle and spiral coefﬁcients (ACPSO)
[66]. We adopt variable settings of the above algorithms
from their original studies in our experiments.
The following experimental settings are adopted. For
each search method, a total of 10 search agents are created
and the maximum number of 20 generations is used for
hyperparameter search. All the search methods perform the
same number (i.e. 200) of function evaluations. A set of 5
runs was conducted for each search method. For both
EfﬁcientNet-B0 and EfﬁcientNet-GRU, Table 9 shows the
search ranges of different hyperparameters. These search
ranges are obtained via trial-and-error as discussed in
Section 4.1. A set of ﬁve evaluation metrics, i.e. the mean
precision, recall, accuracy, AUC scores and the Wilcoxon
rank sum (RS) test, is used for performance comparison.
The details of the experimental studies are presented as
follows.
Again the training and validation sets of the combined
dataset are used for the proposed PSO-based hyperparam-
eter search, owing to their representative capabilities.
Because of the large sample sizes of this combined video
deepfake dataset, in order to reduce the high computational
cost of hyperparameter search, the training and validation
sets of the combined dataset were sampled for 5% and
25%,
respectively.
The
validation
cross-entropy
loss
function was used as the objective function for evaluating
each particle. The experiments ranged from 10 to 20 hours
for each of the two models using the sampled training and
validation sets for each hyperparameter search.
4.2.1 Automated hyperparameter search for EfficientNet-
B0
We conduct automated hyperparameter search for Efﬁ-
cientNet-B0 using different search methods based on the
combined training set. The variable conﬁgurations of dif-
ferent search methods are taken from existing studies.
Additionally for each search method, we adopt a swarm
size of 10 and a maximum number of generations of 20. A
set of 5 runs was used for hyperparameter search using
transfer learning based on EfﬁcientNet-B0. The established
ﬁnal networks with identiﬁed optimal settings by each
search method are trained with 30 epochs using the com-
bined training set and tested using the three test sets,
respectively.
The detailed evaluation results, i.e. the mean precision,
recall, accuracy and AUC scores, as well as the Wilcoxon
rank sum test results, for the Celeb-DFv2, DFDC and
combined datasets are shown in Tables 10, 11 and 12. The
AUC score is used as the summary measure of the overall
model performance. Speciﬁcally, a higher AUC score
correlates with a better classiﬁer. The network with a
higher AUC score typically has better capabilities in dis-
tinguishing between fake and real instances. In addition,
the Wilcoxon rank sum test is also performed based on the

AUC scores over 5 runs to indicate the statistical signiﬁ-
cance of the proposed model over baseline search methods.
As depicted in Tables 10, 11 and 12, the proposed PSO-
based EfﬁcientNet-B0 models achieve better results than
those with optimal learning parameters obtained using
other classical and advanced search methods for all three
datasets, in terms of mean precision, recall, accuracy and
AUC scores as well as statistical test results. In addition,
models with settings yielded by GPSO and ABC show
better results than those of the networks optimized by all
other baseline methods across the datasets.
Figures 8, 9 and 10 illustrate the Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) curves of the devised models by all
search methods for the three datasets, respectively. The
discriminative capabilities of the proposed PSO-optimized
EfﬁcientNet-B0 models are also indicated by the AUC
score comparison, as depicted in Figs. 8, 9 and 10. Our
optimized EfﬁcientNet-B0 models obtain the best AUC
scores in all test cases. The superiority of the proposed
PSO-based EfﬁcientNet-B0 models is further ascertained
by the Wilcoxon rank sum test results based on the AUC

scores (see the last columns in Tables 10, 11 and 12),
which are all lower than 0.05 for all three test sets. This
indicates that our optimized EfﬁcientNet-B0 models out-
perform those devised by other search methods with a
statistical signiﬁcance.
The mean optimized hyperparameters over 5 runs for
EfﬁcientNet-B0 using the sampled combined dataset are
provided in Table 13. These yielded hyperparameters by
different search methods are analysed to justify perfor-
mance variations in the optimized networks. In addition,
we also visualize the effects of different optimized dropout
rates in Figure 11, which shows accuracy rates of the three
test sets (in the y-axis) along with the dropout hyperpa-
rameters (in the x-axis) identiﬁed by each search method
using the sampled combined training set. We use a speciﬁc
shape and colour symbol to represent each search method.
As indicated in Table 13, the proposed PSO-, GPSO-
and ABC-based EfﬁcientNet-B0 models outperform those
with learning conﬁgurations obtained by other search
methods for the three test sets. As shown in Table 13 and
Figure 11, these models are equipped with moderate mean
learning rates and moderate or slightly higher mean drop-
out rates. Such settings are able to deploy steady magnitude
updates to the learning mechanism and produce efﬁcient
sparse network representations with effective discrimina-
tive feature learning capabilities to minimize redundancy.
Signiﬁcantly large or small settings of dropout rates are
identiﬁed by PSO and BBPSO, respectively, as indicated in
Figure 11. These may lead to the switching off of too many
or too few neurons which may in turn result in the
extraction
of
inadequate
or
noisy
spatial
features.

Moreover, as illustrated in Table 13, large mean learning
rates are produced by PSO, SSA, SSO, FA, DA and
ACPSO, which may generate large learning magnitudes to
cause ﬂuctuations in loss space. A small learning rate is
used in combination with a small dropout rate for the
manual setting, resulting in inadequate gradient descent
updates with redundant network topologies, limiting its
performance.
As discussed in Section 4.1.2, moderate settings of
image solutions and number of frames may lead to effec-
tive representations of video inputs while having an opti-
mal computational cost. In contrast, signiﬁcant large
number of frames and image solutions may result in high
computational cost as well as network overﬁtting by cap-
turing noisy irrelevant details. In our experiments, 30-40
frames are recommended in most cases which are able to
capture sufﬁcient RGB and motion details as ascertained
by the empirical results. Image resolutions of 115-126 are
also mostly selected to balance between performance and
computational cost.
4.2.2 Automated hyperparameter search for EfficientNet-
GRU
We also employ the same experimental settings for
hyperparameter search using the EfﬁcientNet-GRU model.
A set of 5 runs is performed for hyperparameter search for
each search algorithm. The optimized settings obtained by
each search method are used to establish the ﬁnal models,
which are trained using the training set of the combined
dataset with a larger number of epochs. These optimized
networks are then evaluated using test sets of Celeb-DFv2,
DFDC and the combined datasets, respectively. Moreover,
the Wilcoxon rank sum test is also performed based on the
AUC scores over 5 runs to indicate the statistical signiﬁ-
cance of our optimized model over those with optimal
settings yielded by other search methods. The detailed
evaluation and statistical test results for our optimized
EfﬁcientNet-GRU models against other devised networks
are provided in Tables 14, 15 and 16.
As shown in Tables 14, 15 and 16, the proposed PSO-
based EfﬁcientNet-GRU models obtain better perfor-
mances than those of the counterparts generated by all the
baseline search methods in terms of the all evaluation
metrics (i.e. precision, recall, accuracy, AUC and Wil-
coxon rank sum test results) for all three test sets. In
addition,
models
with
hyperparameters
produced
by
ACPSO, GPSO and SSO obtain better mean accuracy rates
and AUC scores than the results of those with learning
conﬁgurations selected by other baselines in most test
cases. The ROC curves of the optimized EfﬁcientNet-GRU
models derived by different search methods for the three
test sets are illustrated in Figs. 12, 13 and 14, where our
optimized models show better AUC scores than those of
the networks yielded by other search methods for all test
scenarios. The signiﬁcance of our optimized EfﬁcientNet-
GRU models is further ascertained by the Wilcoxon rank
sum statistical test results. As illustrated in the last columns
in Tables 14, 15 and 16, all the statistical test results are
lower than 0.05 for the three test sets, which indicate the
statistical superiority of our optimized networks against
those yielded by other search methods.

The mean hyperparameters obtained by each search
method over 5 runs using the sampled training and vali-
dation sets of the combined dataset are shown in Table 17.
Some further analysis of these optimized hyperparameters
is provided below to explain model performance variations.
As indicated in Table 17 and 14, 15 and 16 pertaining to
selected hyperparameter settings and detailed evaluation
results, respectively, the proposed PSO algorithm, ACPSO,
GPSO and SSO have obtained comparatively moderate
mean learning rate and dropout rate conﬁgurations over a
set of 5 runs, in comparison with those obtained by other
search methods. Such moderate mean learning rates show
great efﬁciency in extracting knowledge in a new domain
by deploying reasonable magnitudes of learning updates.
The identiﬁed mean dropout rate settings reduce redun-
dancy by switching off reasonable numbers of neurons,
while generating effective discriminative video represen-
tations. Among the baseline methods, ABC, BBPSO, SSA,
FA, DA and BBPSOV-based networks are equipped with
large learning rates, resulting in the employment of large
magnitudes for the learning updates to cause instability.
ABC, BBPSO and BBPSOV also produce large mean
dropout rates which lead to the elimination of large num-
bers of neurons, thus resulting in discarding important
spatial–temporal cues. Moreover, smaller mean learning
rates are identiﬁed by PSO and FPA, as well as adopted in
the manual setting, which may yield insufﬁcient momen-
tum for network upgrading towards global optima, lower-
ing network performance.

In particular, Figure 15 shows the accuracy rates of the
EfﬁcientNet-GRU models for three test sets (in the y-axis)
with manual and optimal dropout rates identiﬁed by each
search method (in the x-axis). As mentioned above, high
accuracy rates are correlated with the moderate settings of
dropout rates, which are preferred by the proposed PSO
algorithm, ACPSO, GPSO and SSO. Signiﬁcantly larger
dropout rate conﬁgurations, such as those obtained by
ABC, BBPSO and BBPSOV, reduce the model perfor-
mance by constraining network representations consider-
ately, while excessively small settings of the dropout rates,
recommended by FPA, FA and DA, may lead to redundant
network structures with limited ﬂexibilities in tackling
overﬁtting.
Similar to the ﬁndings of the previous experiments using
EfﬁcientNet-B0, most search methods select 30-39 frames
leading to the capture of sufﬁcient spatial–temporal pat-
terns using EfﬁcientNet-GRU, while avoiding overﬁtting.
Image resolutions of 113-125 are mostly identiﬁed to
achieve reliable classiﬁcation performance while main-
taining efﬁcient computational cost.
In short, when the hyperparameters obtained using the
proposed PSO method are used in network evaluation, both
optimized EfﬁcientNet-B0 and EfﬁcientNet-GRU models
show improvement over those with manual and optimal
settings yielded by other search methods. This is owing to
the efﬁcient search capabilities of the proposed PSO
algorithm by integrating composite leaders and reinforce-
ment learning-based search strategy selection in identifying
optimal hyperparameters in a multi-dimensional complex
search space with challenging high intra-class and low
inter-class variations.
We analyse the search behaviours of each algorithm
below. ABC explores the search space by following ran-
domly selected leader individuals and therefore shows a
slow convergence rate to reach global optimality. SSA
simulates the salp chain behaviours by adopting the mean
position of a neighbouring follower salp and the current
individual for movement update. Owing to the adoption of
neighbouring solution for search exploration, SSA is more
likely to converge prematurely and requires a signiﬁcant
number of iterations to obtain competitive performance.
Also a random threshold is used in SSA to determine the
respective random walk action for updating the leading
salp, instead of using a more informative selection scheme,
therefore limiting its performance.
SSO generates a dynamic leader signal for the position
update of each search agent by using the strongest and
randomly selected vibration intensities, but the model only
employs a single random walk mechanism for position
update. FA employs neighbouring ﬁtter solutions for search
exploration while DA adopts separation, alignment, cohe-
sion, attraction and evading actions for movement update.
But both algorithms use single search strategies for search
space exploration. Similarly, PSO, BBPSO, SPSO with
sine coefﬁcients and GPSO with genetic operators also
mainly employ monotonous search operations guided by
the swarm leader for position update. When the single
search actions in the aforementioned models become
stagnant, there are no substitute search operations available
to reactivate sudden movements of the search agents to
mitigate premature stagnation.
To overcome the above limitations, BBPSOV and
ACPSO adopt two or multiple search mechanisms to better
manage local optima traps. For example, attractiveness and
evading action are exploited in BBPSOV, while ACPSO
employs three subswarms guided by the PSO operations

with adaptive sine, circle and spiral coefﬁcients, respec-
tively. FPA uses search actions led by either the randomly
selected individuals or the swarm leader with Levy search
coefﬁcients. The multiple search actions in the above
algorithms are mostly randomly selected or performed in
sequential orders without the guidance of more informative
selection principles.
In comparison with the above search algorithms, a
reinforcement learning algorithm is employed in the pro-
posed PSO variant to generate a more informed strategy to
identify the optimal selection of different search actions for
each particle. Such Q-learning-based search deployment
governed by Bellman equation empowers the search pro-
cess with bespoke particle behaviours to explore the search
space effectively while accelerating convergence. On top
of it, search operations guided by multiple composite
leaders yielded by distinctive nonlinear functions are also
used to divert the search process if the action led by the
swarm leader becomes stagnant. The above analysis has
been further evidenced by the evaluation and statistical test
results in our empirical studies.
4.3 Comparison with other hybrid networks
and 3D CNNs
We conduct performance comparison between our opti-
mized EfﬁcientNet-B0 and EfﬁcientNet-GRU models and
other networks including ResNet50-GRU, ResNet101-
GRU, GoogLeNet-GRU, as well as 3D CNNs such as
Inﬂated-3D (I3D), a Mixed Convolution Network (MC3),
3D ResNeXt101 and 3D ResNeXt50, using the Celeb-
DFv2, DFDC and combined datasets, respectively. These
baseline state-of-the-art networks are selected because of
their signiﬁcant discriminative capabilities in video clas-
siﬁcation [9, 42, 60, 67]. Similar to our work, for the hybrid
networks, i.e. ResNet50-GRU, ResNet101-GRU and Goo-
gLeNet-GRU, the respective CNN (ResNet50, ResNet101
and GoogLeNet) models are pretrained using ImageNet
and their successive GRU models are trained from scratch
using our combined deepfake training set.
In addition, for 3D CNNs, 3D convolutions instead of
2D convolutions are used for feature learning, except for
MC3 where mixed convolutions are used. Precisely, MC3
employs 3D convolutions in ﬁrst two groups and 2D con-
volutions from group 3 onwards [68]. 3D ResNeXt101 and
3D ResNeXt50 are variants of 3D ResNet, which introduce
a cardinality parameter to control the number of parallel
paths within each residual block [69]. All the above 3D
CNNs are pre-trained using a large human action dataset,
i.e. Kinetics, consisting of 306,245 videos from 400 clas-
ses, then ﬁne-tuned using the combined deepfake training
set for real/manipulated video classiﬁcation.
All the selected hybrid and 3D CNN baseline networks
are equipped with the following learning settings, i.e.
learning rate = 0.0001, dropout rate = 0.3, image size = 112
and number of frames = 40. Tables 18, 19 and 20 show the
detailed evaluation results, while Figs. 16, 17 and 18
illustrate respective ROC curves, for the Celeb-DFv2,
DFDC and combined test sets, respectively.
As indicated in Tables 18, 19 and 20 and Figs. 16, 17
and 18, the proposed PSO-optimized EfﬁcientNet-B0 and
EfﬁcientNet-GRU models show competitive performances
as compared with those of the aforementioned three hybrid
and four 3D CNN models, across datasets. The proposed
optimizer employs multiple composite elite signals and
Q-learning-based search operation allocation with bespoke
search behaviours of each particle, to boost model capa-
bilities in tackling stagnation. Our optimized networks are
thus equipped with better learning settings and show
enhanced capabilities in spatial–temporal feature learning
for video forgery classiﬁcation. In addition, ResNet101-
GRU shows better results than those of ResNet50-GRU
and GoogLeNet-GRU, because of its more effective feature
learning capabilities using deeper residual blocks. Among
the 3D CNNs, I3D illustrates more discriminative capa-
bilities by inﬂating all the ﬁlters and pooling kernels in a
2D architecture through the insertion of an additional
temporal dimension and thus achieves the most reliable
performance. It outperforms MC3, 3D ResNeXt101 and 3D
ResNeXt50 for most test scenarios.

generate these confusion matrix results, along with those
for other evaluation metrics (i.e. accuracy, precision, recall
and AUC scores) in this research.
Since all the search methods employ the same number
of function evaluations for hyperparameter search, with
deep learning-based ﬁtness function evaluation as the most
costly process, these methods have a similar overall cost
for optimal parameter selection at the training stage. We
provide the average cost of each algorithm with one
function evaluation over 5 runs for computational efﬁ-
ciency comparison. Such a mean cost for each trial is
calculated by averaging the cost for hyperparameter search
by the number of function evaluations performed. This
includes the cost of dedicated search operations embedded
in each algorithm along with one ﬁtness evaluation of the
recommended hyperparameters using either EfﬁcientNet-
B0 or EfﬁcientNet-GRU. The cost variations are mainly
caused by different search principles operated in the search
methods. Table 21 depicts the detailed cost comparison.
We conduct the computational cost comparison using a
NVIDIA RTX 3090 consumer GPU. As indicated in
Table 21, the proposed model shows moderate mean
computational costs per function evaluation over 5 runs for
both networks. ABC, SSA, FA, FPA and BBPSO have
lower mean computational costs owing to their compara-
tively simpler search strategies by following randomly
selected (ABC), neighbouring (SSA and FA) and global
best (BBPSO and FPA) solutions, respectively. DA
employs a search action combining separation, alignment,
cohesion, attraction and evading mechanisms, also showing
relatively light computational costs. SSO performs vibra-

generation, resulting in slightly higher but reasonable costs.
In contrast, BBPSOV and ACPSO have the highest com-
putational costs due to diverse embedded search actions,
e.g. evading/attraction-inspired mechanisms in BBPSOV,
and three subswarms with adaptive sine, circle and spiral
search coefﬁcients in ACPSO. The proposed model, GPSO
and SPSO show moderate costs because of the deployment
of
reinforcement
learning-based
action
selection
and
hybrid leader generation in our model, crossover and
mutation operations in GPSO, and adaptive sine-based
search coefﬁcients in SPSO, respectively. The optimal
conﬁgurations identiﬁed by each method in the training
process are used to construct the ﬁnal network at the test
stage for performance comparison.
We also compare our optimized networks with other
existing studies for Celeb-DFv2 and DFDC datasets. The
selected existing studies were evaluated using the ofﬁcial
Celeb-DFv2 test set and the DFDC subset, respectively, as
performed in our experiments. But since these related
studies were trained using a variety of deepfake training
databases for evaluating both datasets, they are used for
loose performance comparison. Tables 22 and 23 illustrate
the performance comparison with state-of-the-art existing
studies
using
the
Celeb-DFv2
and
DFDC
datasets,
respectively.
We used the ofﬁcial split to evaluate the Celeb-DFv2
dataset. Speciﬁcally, for the ofﬁcial Celeb-DFv2 test set,
the selected existing studies shown in Table 22 obtained
accuracy rates ranging from 0.8074 to 0.8989 and AUC
scores ranging from 0.696 to 0.9003. Our transfer learning
using
EfﬁcientNet-B0
with
the
proposed
PSO-based
hyperparameter ﬁne-tuning obtained a competitive bench-
mark with an accuracy rate of 0.9247 and an AUC score of
0.8985, while EfﬁcientNet-GRU with the proposed PSO-
based hyperparameter selection achieved a better accuracy
rate of 0.9382 and a better AUC result of 0.9141. Both of
our models outperform most of these related studies by a
sufﬁcient margin.
Table 23 shows the comparison between our optimized
networks and existing studies for the DFDC test set. Again
our
optimized
EfﬁcientNet-GRU
and
EfﬁcientNet-B0
models with the proposed PSO-based hyperparameter ﬁne-
tuning obtain more reliable performance in comparison
with those of existing studies. Speciﬁcally, the Efﬁ-
cientNet-B0 model with the proposed PSO-based hyper-
parameter selection achieves a competitive mean accuracy
rate of 0.9414 and AUC score of 0.9161, and our optimized
EfﬁcientNet-GRU obtains a better mean accuracy rate of
0.9517 and a better AUC score of 0.9346.
In short, owing to the efﬁcient search capabilities of the
proposed PSO model guided by composite leaders and
optimized search strategies governed by the ﬁtness evalu-
ations, our optimized networks outperform existing studies
for both Celeb-DFv2 and DFDC datasets and show great

In
addition, our work also highlights the importance of
hyperparameter selection in deep learning networks and the
potential use of evolutionary algorithms in such tasks for
video deepfake classiﬁcation.
5 Visualization using gradient-weighted
class activation mapping
Various evolutionary and sensitivity-based methods are
proposed for feature selection [19, 83–85]. Owing to the
large feature dimensions extracted from multiple video
frames, in this research, we visualize the contributions of
different convolutional and spatial features using class-
discriminative heatmaps, to indicate the effectiveness of
our optimized networks for discriminative feature extrac-
tion. Speciﬁcally, we generate heatmaps using gradient-
weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) [86] for
both proposed EfﬁcientNet serialized with GRU, as well as
the proposed PSO-optimized EfﬁcientNet to indicate their
effectiveness in feature learning. In particular, as indicated
earlier, in the proposed EfﬁcientNet-GRU model, all the
convolutional layers of the ImageNet pre-trained Efﬁ-
cientNet are slightly ﬁne-tuned using the combined training
set with a small number of epochs (e.g. 5 epochs) with the
attempt to improve their discriminative feature learning
capabilities in the target domain.
First of all, since this research focuses on detection and
classiﬁcation of face swapping and facial re-enactment,
MTCNN-based facial cropping is performed to extract the
facial regions and eliminate background noise. Besides
that, for both EfﬁcientNet-B0 and EfﬁcienNet-GRU mod-
els, as discussed in Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2, the proposed
PSO and other search methods are used to optimize the
number of video frames and image resolution sizes, along
with learning and dropout rates, to maintain optimal cost

avoid

To indicate the effectiveness of the proposed PSO-based
EfﬁcientNet model and the EfﬁcientNet embedded in
EfﬁcientNet-GRU for feature learning, Grad-CAM [86]
heatmaps with different colour schemes are used to visu-
alize the importance of the extracted features from the
cropped facial regions. Grad-CAM ﬁrst calculates the
gradient of the prediction score for a target class with
respect to the extracted feature maps in the last convolu-
tional layer. Then the global average pooling is applied to
gradients calculated above to generate weightings of
respective feature maps for a target class. The yielded
importance
weightings
subsequently
multiply
with
respective feature maps. A summation operation followed
by a ReLU activation function is performed on these
weighted results to produce the Grad-CAM heatmaps.
These localization maps indicate feature signiﬁcance to
class prediction using different colour schemes with deep
red indicating the most signiﬁcant/relevant characteristics
and deep blue as the least inﬂuential factors for catego-
rization. Therefore, such class-discriminative heatmaps are
used in this research to visualize which image regions have
the most inﬂuence to synthetic/original video classiﬁcation.
In comparison with class activation mapping (CAM), the
Grad-CAM method can be applied to any CNN architec-
tures even without re-training [86]. In addition, as men-
tioned above, in this research, to improve discriminative
feature learning, we ﬁne-tune all the convolutional layers
of the ImageNet pre-trained EfﬁcientNet-B0 embedded in
the proposed EfﬁcientNet-GRU model using the combined
training set with a small number of epochs (i.e. 5 epochs),
before feature extraction. Therefore, we generate Grad-
CAM heatmaps for this EfﬁcientNet-B0 model with light-
weight ﬁne-tuning embedded in the EfﬁcientNet-GRU, to
indicate its effectiveness in feature learning. Besides that,
we also generate Grad-CAM heatmaps for the proposed
PSO-optimized EfﬁcientNet-B0 to demonstrate its capa-
bilities in discriminative feature representation.

row) and Grad-CAM heatmaps extracted from lightly-
tuned EfﬁcientNet-B0 embedded in the EfﬁcientNet-GRU
(the third row), as well as the heatmaps generated by the
proposed PSO-optimized EfﬁcientNet-B0 (the fourth row),
with respect to the manipulated image frames in the second
row. Since these example video frames are taken from
Celeb-DFv2, the face swap attack is performed in these
deepfake examples. The inspection of the synthetic image
frames in the second row in Figure 21 against the real
image frames in the ﬁrst row reveals the presence of
vagueness and blurry in the eye, nose, mouth or overall
facial regions, as well as shape alterations of eye, nose and
mouth elements. As indicated in existing studies, incon-
sistent shadowing/lighting/colour tone over faces, unnatu-
ral/inconsistent teeth/mouth/eye movements, misaligned
teeth, distortions in eyebrows, facial hair and facial bor-
ders, double chins, non-circled pupils and other spatial
inconsistency, are key factors for identifying manipulated
images against real ones.
As visualized by Grad-CAM heatmaps shown in the
third and fourth rows in Figure 21, the most signiﬁcant
factors extracted by both the lightly-tuned EfﬁcientNet
(embedded in EfﬁcientNet-GRU) and the proposed PSO-
optimized EfﬁcientNet model are mostly derived from
these facial abnormality regions such as eye and mouth/-
teeth regions. These dominating features are represented by
deep red heatmaps, emphasizing their importance to
manipulated class prediction. As an example, the heatmaps

(embedded in EfﬁcientNet-GRU) in the third row show
high correlations to those manipulated facial regions such
as blurred eye regions, and inconsistent shadowing/light-
ing/colour tone over faces. Built upon this, as shown in the
last row in Figure 21, the proposed PSO-optimized Efﬁ-
cientNet-B0 method with substantial re-training is able to
even better capture such abnormalities and strengthen the
extraction of such important characteristics. For instance,
in most cases, signiﬁcant factors with respect to shadowy
eye regions, unnatural pupils and iris borders, are extracted
by our optimized network. In addition, distortions in facial
borders, misaligned teeth and double chins, which also
have vital inﬂuence to authenticity classiﬁcation, are
identiﬁed as well.
As indicated in the results in Figure 21, both the Efﬁ-
cientNet with light-weight ﬁne-tuning and the proposed
PSO-optimized EfﬁcientNet-B0 model show great efﬁ-
ciency in capturing important discriminative features
playing signiﬁcant roles in synthetic video identiﬁcation. In
addition, the proposed PSO-optimized EfﬁcientNet-B0
network adopts such extracted heatmaps for frame-level
fake/real image classiﬁcation. A mean average ensemble
scheme is used to combine the frame-level prediction based
on a sequence of frames to determine ﬁnal video classiﬁ-
cation outcome. Moreover, in the proposed EfﬁcientNet-
GRU model, the most important spatial features in the
heatmaps extracted using EfﬁcientNet-B0 with light-
weight ﬁne-tuning are further strengthened by combining a
sequence of such class-discriminative Grad-CAM maps
from multiple frames. Such a sequence of discriminative
heatmaps is then passed on to the GRU model for temporal
feature
learning
to
inform
ﬁnal
video
authenticity
identiﬁcation.
Besides the above, as indicated in Sections 4.2.1 and
4.2.2, the proposed PSO model is also used to optimize the
number of frames and image resolution settings for both
EfﬁcientNet-GRU and EfﬁcientNet-B0 networks, in order
to extract salient features without capturing too much noisy
irrelevant/contradictory details to avoid overﬁtting. As an
example, for EfﬁcientNet-B0, a selection of 30-40 frames
and image resolutions of 115-126 is recommended by the
proposed PSO and other search methods owing to a good
balance between performance and computational cost.
Similarly for EfﬁcientNet-GRU, the proposed PSO model
and other search methods recommend the optimal number
of 30-39 frames with image resolutions of 113-125 for
model training and test to better tackle overﬁtting.
These optimized frame and image resolution settings,
along with the effectiveness of the extracted spatial–tem-
poral features by the EfﬁcientNet-B0 with light-weight
ﬁne-tuning and proposed PSO-optimized EfﬁcientNet-B0
models as evidenced in Grad-CAM maps, lead to the
capture of discriminative RGB and motion cues to achieve
reliable video classiﬁcation. Our optimized EfﬁcientNet-
B0 networks also outperform those generated by other
search methods as indicated by the empirical and statistical
test results in Tables 10, 11 and 12. The efﬁciency of our
optimized EfﬁcientNet-GRU models is also ascertained by
the experimental and statistical test results as shown in
Tables 14, 15 and 16.

6 Uncertainty analysis
To indicate model effectiveness, we also conduct uncer-
tainty analysis. We employ the Monte Carlo dropout
(MCD) method for uncertainty quantiﬁcation in this
research. Speciﬁcally, we employ the MCD method to
measure epistemic uncertainty, which is usually caused by
the lack of training data. In other words, with more training
data, such model uncertainty can be reduced. Before
introducing MCD, we brieﬂy discuss the traditional drop-
out method, which is only applied in the training stage by
switching off some randomly selected neurons. And there
is no dropout operation applied during test with all neurons
enabled. The dropout operation provides ﬂexibility in
model training and thus helps tackle overﬁtting. In contrast,
in the MCD method, the dropout is enabled during testing.
This results in different dropout masks to be deployed
during the forward passes for result calculation. These
generated new architectures can be regarded as Monte
Carlo samples. As such, by using dropout during testing,
each test sample will be evaluated using different model
architectures and the result distributions of these test
samples are used in this research for computing different
uncertainty metrics.
Since we focus on a classiﬁcation problem for video
authenticity identiﬁcation, as suggested by existing studies
[87–89], we employ the predictive entropy and mutual
information for uncertainty analysis. Equations 10–11
deﬁne the formulae of the predictive entropy [87].

where C denotes the number of predicted classes with uc
representing the class-wise mean prediction probability. In
addition, T denotes the number of MCD forward passes
employed in our experiments.
The mutual information is formulated in Eq. 12.

where MI indicates mutual information, while Pððy 2
cÞðx; wtÞÞ represents the softmax score for the input sample
x belonging to class c with model parameters wt.
We employ all test video samples, i.e. 3375 videos, from
the combined test set for uncertainty analysis. Each sample
is tested T ¼ 20 times using the MCD method. Table 24
shows the mean predictive entropy (MPE) and mutual
information scores over all test videos with respect to the
EfﬁcientNet and EfﬁcientNet-GRU models with optimized
settings obtained using the proposed PSO model, respec-
tively. Speciﬁcally, MPE_fake, MPE_real and MPE_all in
Table 24 denote the mean predictive entropy scores for the
fake, real and both classes, with Mutual Info indicating the
mean mutual information score for both classes, over all
test samples.
As indicated in Table 24, both optimized networks
obtain low entropy and mutual information scores, which

indicate that the models have high certainty about predic-
tions. In addition, both mean predictive entropy and mutual
information scores of the proposed PSO-based Efﬁ-
cientNet-GRU method are lower than those of the proposed
PSO-based EfﬁcientNet model. This shows that the opti-
mized EfﬁcientNet-GRU model has better discriminative
capabilities for distinguishing synthetic and real videos
with lower uncertainty.
For each optimized network, the mean predictive
entropy scores for both manipulated and real classes are
also provided in Table 24. The mean predictive entropy
scores for the manipulated class are lower than those of the
genuine video class for both networks. Figures 22 and 23
also show the detailed uncertainty estimation distributions
in terms of the predictive entropy for both fake and real
classes for the PSO-devised EfﬁcientNet-GRU and Efﬁ-
cientNet models, respectively. As indicated in Table 24
and Figs. 22, 23, the manipulated videos are classiﬁed with
higher certainty than those of the original videos by both
optimized networks. The combined dataset construction
may help explain the above observations. Since in the
employed deepfake datasets (i.e. Celeb-DFv2 and DFDC),
there are usually much larger numbers of synthetic videos
than those of the genuine ones, real video samples from the
YouTube Faces Database are also borrowed to increase the
real class sample sizes and balance class distributions when
constructing the combined dataset. Therefore, the trained
networks have been encountered with a variety of manip-
ulated instances and show comparatively lower uncertainty
in recognizing fake videos in comparison with the original
ones.
Overall, the mean predictive entropy and mutual infor-
mation scores indicate the effectiveness of both of the
proposed PSO-optimized networks for classifying manip-
ulated and real videos with reasonably high certainty.
7 Evaluation using benchmark functions
To further indicate the effectiveness of the proposed PSO
algorithm, we employ unimodal and multimodal bench-
mark functions with varied search spaces and artiﬁcial
landscapes for evaluation. Multimodal functions such as
Rastrigin, Griewank, Ackley and Powell, as well as uni-
modal
functions
including
Rotated
Hyper-Ellipsoid
(Rothyp),
Dixon-Price
(Dixon),
Sphere,
Rosenbrock,
Zakharov, Sum of Different Powers (Sumpow) and Sum
Squares (Sumsqu), are evaluated in our experiments. The
experiments are conducted using a maximum number of
function evaluations of 25,000 (population = 50 and iter-
ations = 500) and a dimension of 30. This maximum
number of function evaluations (i.e. 25,000) is conducted

and Rosenbrock, respectively, with the proposed model
achieving the second best results for these two test func-
tions. The statistical superiority of the proposed model is
also further evidenced in the rank sum test results shown in
Table 26. Speciﬁcally, our model obtains statistically bet-
ter results than those of the baseline methods for most test
functions, except that SSA and ABC obtain statistically
better results for Griewank and Rosenbrock than those of
the proposed model, respectively.
Besides the Wilcoxon rank sum test, the nonparametric
Friedman test is also conducted. It tests the null hypothesis
that the results of all the treatment methods have identical
distributions or otherwise based on a Chi-square approxi-
mation. Table 27 shows the mean rankings of all the search
methods over 30 runs based on the mean results of all test
functions shown in Table 25 using the Friedman test. The
mean ranking result of each algorithm is obtained by
averaging the rankings of the mean results of all bench-
mark functions. As indicated in Table 27, the proposed
model has the highest mean ranking in comparison with
those of all the baseline methods. ABC and FA also show
competitive rankings against other baseline methods. The
p-value obtained using the Friedman test illustrated in
Table 28 is lower than 0.001. It further ascertains that our
results are better than those of all other search methods
with a statistical signiﬁcance.
The empirical results indicate that the proposed model
has a fast convergence rate in most test cases. Moreover, it
shows better capabilities in tackling local optima traps by
locating the minimum global optima in most test cases.
Example mean convergence curves over 30 runs generated
using the logarithm scale with a base of 10 during the
course of 500 iterations with respect to the Powell, Ackley
and Sphere functions are provided in Figs. 24, 25 and 26,
respectively. The visualization results indicate that the
proposed model navigates various search spaces with a fast
convergence speed. Owing to the adoption of diverse
composite leaders and optimal search action selection
reinforced by Q-learning, as demonstrated in the visualized
convergence curves, the proposed optimizer also shows
better capabilities in tackling local optima traps as com-
pared with those of other baseline methods. A similar trend
is also obtained for other benchmark functions.
To further test model effectiveness, we have also eval-
uated the proposed model using the benchmark functions
with a dimension of 50. The experiments are performed
using the following settings, i.e. population = 50, iteration
= 1000 and trial = 30. A maximum number of 50,000
function evaluations is used by all search methods. The
detailed evaluation and Wilcoxon rank sum statistical test
results are provided in Tables 29 and 30.
As shown in Tables 29 and 30, the proposed model
achieves statistically better results than those of all the
baseline methods for most numerical optimization prob-
lems. In particular, it achieves the most optimal global
minima of ‘0’ for Rotated Hyper-Ellipsoid, Sphere, Sum of
Different Powers and Sum Square functions. The excep-
tions are for Rosenbrock where ABC obtains the best
global minima and outperforms the proposed model with
statistical signiﬁcance. In addition, for Griewank, ABC and
SSA obtain statistical better performances than those of the
proposed model. For these two test functions, i.e. Rosen-
brock and Griewank, the proposed model achieves the
second and third best results, respectively. These numerical
function results also indicate the proposed model with
composite leaders and Q-learning-based search action
optimization possesses better capabilities in tackling local
optima traps and achieves the best global minima in most
test cases.

The signiﬁcance of the proposed model is also further
ascertained by the Friedman test. As indicated in Tables 31
and 32, the proposed model dominates the highest mean
ranking for solving benchmark functions with dimension =
50 as compared with those of other search methods. The p-
value from the Friedman test is also lower than 0.05, which
indicates that the proposed model is better than all the
baseline methods with a statistical signiﬁcance.
Figures 27 and 28 depict the mean convergence curves
of all search methods over 30 runs during the course of
1000 iterations with respect to the Powell and Rotated
Hyper-Ellipsoid functions. As mentioned earlier, these
mean convergence graphs are generated using the loga-
rithm scale with a base of 10 for these example test func-
tions. As indicated in Figs. 27 and 28, the proposed model
illustrates sufﬁcient capabilities in navigating through
complex search spaces and shows great competence in
tackling local optima traps. For the Rotated Hyper-Ellip-
soid function, the proposed model achieves the global
minimum of ‘0’ since iteration 657 based on the results
over 30 runs. Owing to the fact that log10 0 ¼ 1, the
convergence curve of our optimizer is shown until iteration
656. These convergence graphs again illustrate the model’s
fastest convergence rates and its competitive capabilities in
achieving the most optimal global minima, in comparison
with those of all the baseline search methods. A similar
trend is also observed for the proposed optimizer for other
benchmark functions.
8 Conclusion
In this research, we have proposed transfer learning and
hybrid deep networks with PSO-based optimal hyperpa-
rameter selection for undertaking deepfake classiﬁcation. A
new PSO model is proposed for optimal hyperparameter
search by integrating composite leader generation and
reinforcement learning-based search operation adjustment.
The preprocessing of face cropping is also conducted to
extract the facial regions and eliminate background noise.
Evaluated using several challenging deepfake datasets, the
proposed
PSO-optimized
EfﬁcientNet-B0
and
Efﬁ-
cientNet-GRU models show enhanced performance. In
particular, EfﬁcientNet-GRU with optimal settings yielded
by our proposed optimizer achieves the best benchmarks
and outperforms existing studies signiﬁcantly in different
experimental
settings.
The
proposed
optimizer
also
achieves statistically better performance against those of
other search methods in solving diverse unimodal and
multimodal mathematical landscapes.
The next steps for this research could include further
exploration of different loss functions and the integration

with other optimization algorithms to further enhance
performance. Additionally, incorporating more diverse and
larger datasets for model training could also help improve
deepfake detection accuracy. Another potential direction
would be to investigate the use of other state-of-the-art
models, such as transformer-based models and contrastive
learning, for deepfake detection. Such explorations could
provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of different
approaches for handling the deepfake detection problem.
