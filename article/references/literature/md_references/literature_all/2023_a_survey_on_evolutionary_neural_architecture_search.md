Abstract—Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved great
success in many applications. The architectures of DNNs play
a crucial role in their performance, which is usually manually
designed with rich expertise. However, such a design process
is labour intensive because of the trial-and-error process, and
also not easy to realize due to the rare expertise in practice.
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a type of technology that can
design the architectures automatically. Among different methods
to realize NAS, Evolutionary Computation (EC) methods have
recently gained much attention and success. Unfortunately, there
has not yet been a comprehensive summary of the EC-based NAS
algorithms. This paper reviews over 200 papers of most recent
EC-based NAS methods in light of the core components, to sys-
tematically discuss their design principles as well as justiﬁcations
on the design. Furthermore, current challenges and issues are also
discussed to identify future research in this emerging ﬁeld.

I. INTRODUCTION
D
EEP Neural Networks (DNNs), as the cornerstone of deep
learning [1], have demonstrated their great success in di-
verse real-world applications, including image classiﬁcation [2],
[3], natural language processing [4], speech recognition [5],
to name a few. The promising performance of DNNs has
been widely documented due to their deep architectures [1],
which can learn meaningful features directly from the raw data
almost without any explicit feature engineering. Generally,
the performance of DNNs depends on two aspects: their
architectures and the associated weights. Only when both
achieve the optimal status simultaneously, the performance
of the DNNs could be expected promising. The optimal
weights are often obtained through a learning process: using a
continuous loss function to measure the discrepencies between
the real output and the desired one, and then the gradient-
based algorithms are often used to minimize the loss. When
the termination condition is satisﬁed, which is commonly
a maximal iteration number, the algorithm can often ﬁnd a
good set of weights [1]. This kind of process has been very
popular owing to its effectiveness in practice, and has become
the dominant practice for weight optimization [6], although

University, Hong Kong.
they are principally local-search [7] algorithms. On the other
hand, obtaining the optimal architectures cannot be directly
formulated by a continuous function, and there is even no
explicit function to measure the process for ﬁnding optimal
architectures.
To this end, there has been a long time that the promising
architectures of DNNs are manually designed with rich
expertise. This can be evidenced from the state of the arts, such
as VGG [8], ResNet [2] and DenseNet [3]. These promising
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models are all manually
designed by the researchers with rich knowledge in both neural
networks and image processing. However, in practice, most end
users are not with such kinds of knowledge. Moreover, DNN
architectures are often problem-dependent. If the distribution
of the data is changed, the architectures must be redesigned
accordingly. Neural Architecture Search (NAS), which aims to
automate the architecture designs of deep neural networks,
is identiﬁed as a promising way to address the challenge
aforementioned.
Mathematically, NAS can be modeled by an optimization
problem formulated by Equation (1):
 arg minA = L(A, Dtrain, Dfitness)
s.t.
A ∈A
(1)
where A denotes the search space of the potential neural
architectures, L(·) measures the performance of the architecture
A on the ﬁtness evaluation dataset Dfitness after being trained
on the training dataset Dtrain. The L(·) is usually non-convex
and non-differentiable [9]. In principle, NAS is a complex
optimization problem experiencing several challenges, e.g.,
complex constraints, discrete representations, bi-level struc-
tures, computationally expensive characteristics and multiple
conﬂicting criteria. NAS algorithms refer to the optimization
algorithms which are speciﬁcally designed to effectively and
efﬁciently solve the problem represented by Equation (1). The
initial work of NAS algorithms is commonly viewed as the
work in [10], which was proposed by Google. The pre-print
version of this work was ﬁrstly released in the website of
arXiv1 in 2016, and then was formally accepted for publication
by the International Conference on Learning Representations
(ICLR) in 2017. Since then, a large number of researchers
have been investing tremendous efforts in developing novel
NAS algorithms.
Based on the optimizer employed, existing NAS algorithms
can be broadly classiﬁed into three different categories:

Reinforcement Learning (RL) [11] based NAS algorithms,
gradient-based NAS algorithms, and Evolutionary Computa-
tion (EC) [12] based NAS algorithms (ENAS). Speciﬁcally,
RL based algorithms often require thousands of Graphics
Processing Cards (GPUs) performing several days even on
median-scale dataset, such as the CIFAR-10 image classiﬁcation
benchmark dataset [13]. Gradient-based algorithms are more
efﬁcient than RL based algorithms. However, they often ﬁnd
the ill-conditioned architectures due to the improper relation
for adapting to gradient-based optimization. Unfortunately,
the relation has not been mathematically proven. In addition,
the gradient-based algorithms require to construct a super-
net in advance, which also highly requires expertise. The
ENAS algorithms solve the NAS by exploiting EC techniques.
Speciﬁcally, EC is a class of population-based computational
paradigms, simulating the evolution of species or the behaviors
of the population in nature, to solve challenging optimization
problems. In particular, Genetic Algorithms (GAs) [14], Genetic
Programming (GP) [15], and Particle Swarm Optimization
(PSO) [16] are widely used EC methods in practice. Owing to
the promising characteristics of EC methods in insensitiveness
to the local minima and no requirement to gradient information,
EC has been widely applied to solve complex non-convex
optimization problems [17], even when the mathematical form
of the objective function is not available [18].
In fact, the EC methods had been frequently used more
than twenty years ago, searching for not only the optimal
neural architectures but also the weights of neural networks
simultaneously, which is also termed as neuroevolution [19].
The major differences between ENAS and neuroevolution
lie in two aspects. Firstly, neuroevolution often uses EC to
search for both the neural architectures and the optimal weight
values, while ENAS for now focuses mainly on searching for
the architectures and the optimal weight values are obtained
by using the gradient-based algorithms2 immediately after.
Secondly, neuroevolution commonly applies to small-scale and
median-scale neuron networks, while ENAS generally works
on DNNs, such as the deep CNNs [23], [24] and deep stacked
autoencoders [25], which are stacked by the building blocks of
deep learning techniques [1]. Generally, the ﬁrst work of ENAS
is often viewed as the LargeEvo algorithm [23] which was
proposed by Google who released its early version in March
2017 in arXiv. Afterwards, this paper got accepted into the 34th
International Conference on Machine Learning in June 2017.
The LargeEvo algorithm employed a GA to search for the best
architecture of a CNN, and the experimental results on CIFAR-
10 and CIFAR-100 [13] have demonstrated its effectiveness.
Since then, a large number of ENAS algorithms have been
proposed. Fig. 1 shows the number of similar works3 published
from 2017 to 2020 when this survey paper was ready for
2Please note that we still categorize some existing algorithms as the ENAS
algorithm, such as API [20], EvoCNN [21] and EvoDeep [22], although they
also concern the weights. This is because the optimal weight values of the
DNNs searched by them are still obtained by the gradient-based algorithms.
They only searched for the best weight initialization values or the best weight
initialization method of the DNNs.

the number of submissions grows with multiple scales.
A large number of related submissions have been made
available publicly, but there is no comprehensive survey of the
literature on ENAS algorithms. Although recent reviews on
NAS have been made in [18], [26]–[28], they mainly focus
on reviewing different methods to realize NAS, rather than
concentrating on the ENAS algorithms. Speciﬁcally, Elsken et
al. [26] divided NAS into three stages: search space, search
strategy, and performance estimation strategy. Similarly, Wis-
tuba et al. [27] followed these three stages with an additional
review about the multiple objectives in NAS. Darwish et
al. [18] made a summary of Swarm Intelligence (SI) and
Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) approaches for deep learning,
with the focuses on both NAS and other hyperparameter
optimization. Stanley et al.
[28] went through a review of
neuroevolution, aiming at revealing the weight optimization
rather than the architecture of neural networks. Besides, most of
the references in these surveys are pre-2019 and do not include
an update on the papers published during the past two years
when most ENAS works were published. This paper presents
a survey involving a large number of ENAS papers, with
the expectation to inspire some new ideas for enhancing the
development of ENAS. To allow readers easily concentrating
on the technical part of this survey, we also follow the three
stages to introduce ENAS algorithms, which has been widely
adopted by existing NAS survey papers [18], [26], [27], but
with essential modiﬁcations made to speciﬁcally suit ENAS
algorithms.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The
background of ENAS is discussed in Section II. Section III
documents different encoding spaces, initial spaces and search
spaces of ENAS algorithms. In Section IV, the encoding strat-
egy and architecture representation are introduced. Section V
summarizes the process of population updating, including
evolutionary operators and selection strategies. Section VI
shows multiple ways to speed up the evolution. Section VII
presents the applications of ENAS algorithms. Section VIII
discusses the challenges and prospects, and ﬁnally Section IX
presents conclusions.

As discussed above, ENAS is a process of searching for
the optimal architectures of DNNs by using EC methods. In

this section, we will ﬁrst introduce the uniﬁed ﬂow chart of
ENAS in Subsection II-A. Then, the categories of EC methods
based on their search strategies and the categories of DNN
architectures in Subsections II-B and II-C, respectively.
A. Flow Chart of ENAS
Fig. 2 shows an illustration of the ﬂowchart of an ENAS
algorithm. Speciﬁcally, the evolutionary process takes place in
the initial space and the search space sequentially. First of all, a
population is initialized within the initial space that is deﬁned in
advance. Each individual in the population represents a solution
for the ENAS, i.e., a DNN architecture. Each architecture needs
to be encoded as an individual before it joins the population.
Second, the ﬁtness of the generated individuals is evaluated.
Note that there are two ﬁtness evaluation steps as shown in
Fig. 2, which commonly employ the same evaluation criterion.
Thirdly, after the ﬁtness evaluation of the initial population,
the whole population starts the evolutionary process within
the search space, which is shown by the dashed box in Fig. 2.
In the evolutionary process, the population is updated by the
selection and the evolutionary operators in each iteration, until
the stopping criterion is met. Please note that the selection
stage is not necessary for some other EC paradigms like SI.
Finally, a population that has ﬁnished the evolution is obtained.
In the following sections, these key steps are documented in
detail.
B. Evolutionary Search Strategy
ENAS is distinguished from other NAS methods by its
employed optimization approach, i.e., the EC methods, where
the optimization approaches can be further subdivided based
on the search strategy that the optimization approach adopted.
Fig. 3 provides such an illustration from three aspects: EAs,
Swarm Intelligence (SI), and others, and more detailed statistics
can be observed in Table III. In practice, the EA-based methods
account for the majority of existing ENAS algorithms, where
the GA takes a large part of EA-based methods. The other
categories of EC methods are also important parts for realizing
ENAS algorithms, such as GP, Evolutionary Strategy (ES), PSO,
Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) [29], Differential Evolution
(DE) [30], Fireﬂy Algorithm (FA) [31]. In this paper, the Hill-
Climbing Algorithm (HCA) is classiﬁed into EC paradigm

because it can be regarded as an EA with a simple selection
mechanism and without crossover operation [32]. HCA has
been well known as a widely used local search algorithm in
memetic algorithms [33].
C. Common Neural Networks in ENAS
The end product of ENAS is all about DNNs, which can be
broadly divided into ﬁve different categories: CNN, Deep Belief
Network (DBN), Stacked Auto-Encoder (SAE), Recurrent
Neural Network (RNN) and others. The brief fact can be
seen from Fig. 4, and a detailed illustration will be shown in
Table III.
Most ENAS methods are proposed for searching for the
optimal CNN architectures. This is because many hand-crafted
CNNs, such as VGG [8], ResNet [2] and DenseNet [3],
have demonstrated their superiority in handling the image
classiﬁcation tasks which is the most successful applications
in the deep learning ﬁeld. Generally, the CNN architecture is
composed of the convolutional layers, the pooling layers and
the fully-connected layers, and a common example of CNNs is
shown in Fig. 5 (a). The optimization of CNN architecture is
mainly composed of three aspects: the hyperparameters of each
layer [34], the depth of the architecture [21] and the connections
between layers [35]. In practice, the majority of the ENAS
methods consider the above three aspects collectively [23],
[36].
DBN [37] is made up by stacking multiple Restricted
Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), and an example can be seen in
Fig. 5 (b). Speciﬁcally, RBMs have connections only between
layers, while without any inter-layer connection. Meanwhile,
RBMs allow the DBN to be trained in an unsupervised manner
to obtain a good weight initialization. There are two commonly
used types of hyperparameters needed to be optimized in DBN:
the number of neurons in each layer [38] and the number of
layers [39], [40].
An SAE is constructed by stacking multiple of its building
blocks which are AEs. An AE aims to learn meaningful
representations from the raw input data by restoring its input
data as its objective [41]. Generally, an AE is typically
composed of two symmetrical components: the encoder and
the decoder, and an example including both parts is shown

in Fig. 5 (c). Generally, some ENAS methods only take the
encoder into evolution [25], [42] because the decoder part is
symmetric with the encoder and can be derived accordingly.
Yet, some other ENAS methods optimize the hyperparameters
of encoders and decoders separately [43], [44].
The most signiﬁcant difference between RNNs and the neural
networks introduced above is its recurrent connection. Fig. 5
(d) shows the time-expanded structure of an RNN, where the
value of current hidden layer ht is inﬂuenced by the value at
its previous time slot ht−1 and the output value of its previous
layer. Because these layers are reused, all the weights (i.e., U,
W and V in the ﬁgure) are shared. Different from focusing
on the number of neurons and the number of layers in the
feedforward neural network, some ENAS methods concern
about how many times the RNN should be unfold [45], [46].
In addition, there remain other neural networks like typical
DNNs, which are made up of only fully-connected layers,
where the connections are formed by all the neurons in the
two adjacent layers. Because such kind of DNNs is not the
major target investigated by NAS, we will not introduce it in
detail.
When the ENAS algorithms are applied to these DNNs,
the goal is to ﬁnd the best architecture-related parameters.
Speciﬁcally, for CNNs, they are the number of convolutional
layers, pooling layers, fully-connected layers, and parameters
related to these layers (such as the kernel size of the convolu-
tional layers, the pooling type, and the number of neurons for
fully-connected layers, and so on) as well as their connection
situation (such as the dense connection and the skip connection).
For DBN and SAE, they are the number of their building
blocks, i.e., the RBM for DBN and the AE for SAE, and the

architecture-related parameters mentioned above, the number
of the time slot is also an important parameter to be optimized
by ENAS algorithms. For the traditional DNNs, the ENAS
algorithms often concern about the neuron number of each
layer. In addition, some ENAS algorithms also concern the
weights, such as the weight initialization method and weigh
initial values. Table I summarizes the detail of the common
parameters optimized by ENAS methods in different types of
neural networks, including the CNNs as the most popular type.
The details of these ENAS algorithms will be documented in
the following sections.
III. ENCODING SPACE
The encoding space contains all the valid individuals encoded
in the population. In terms of the basic units, the encoding
space can be divided into three categories according to the basic
units they adopt. They are the layer-based encoding space, the
block-based encoding space and the cell-based encoding space.
In addition, some ENAS methods do not take the conﬁguration
of the basic unit into consideration, but care the connections
between units. Such kind of encoding space is often called the
topology-based encoding space.
In addition, the constraints on the encoding space are im-
portant. This is because they represent the human intervention
which restricts the encoding space and lightens the burden of
the evolutionary process. A method with a mass of constraints
can obtain a promising architecture easily but prevent to design
any novel architecture that does not follow the constraints.
Furthermore, the different sizes of the search space would
greatly affect the efﬁciency of the evolution. On the other hand,
the effectiveness of the ENAS methods cannot be guaranteed
if there is no constraint on the search space: one extreme case
is that all the individuals in the search space are mediocre. In
this case, an excellent individual can be obtained even without
selection. Table II shows different kinds of encoding spaces
and the constraints of existing ENAS algorithms, where the
ﬁrst row shows the constraints and the ﬁrst column displays
the encoding space. In the following, we will discuss them at
length.
A. Encoding Space and Constraints
The layer-based encoding space denotes that the basic
units in the encoding space are the primitive layers, such

as convolution layers and fully-connected layers. This would
lead to a huge search space, since it tries to encode so much
information in the search space. However, it may take more
time to search for a promising individual because there are
more possibilities to construct a well-performed DNN from the
primitive layers. For example, a promising CNN is commonly
composed of hundreds of primitive layers, accordingly, the
search process will consume more time to search for such a
deep architecture by iteratively stacking the primitive layers.
In addition, the promising DNN may not be found if only with
the primitive layers. For instance, the promising performance
of ResNet is widely recognized due to its skip connections
which cannot be represented by the primitive layers.
To alleviate the above problems, the block-based encoding
space is developed, where various layers of different types are
combined as the blocks to serve as the basic unit of the encoding
space. Traditional blocks are ResBlock [2], DenseBlock [3],
ConvBlock (Conv2d + BatchNormalization + Activation) [32]
and InceptionBlock [141], etc. Speciﬁcally, layers in the
blocks have a speciﬁc topological relationship, such as the
residual connection in ResBlock and the dense connections in
DenseBlock. These blocks have promising performance and
often require fewer parameters to build the architecture. So it
is principally easier to ﬁnd a good architecture in the block-
based encoding space compared to the layer-based encoding
space. Some ENAS algorithms used these blocks directly, such
as [9], [76], while other methods proposed different blocks for
different purposes. For example, Chen et al. [108] proposed
eight blocks including ResBlock and InceptionBlock encoded
in a 3-bit string, and used Hamming distance to determine the
similar blocks. Song et al. [114] proposed three residual-dense-
mixed blocks to reduce the amount of computation due to the
convolution operation of image super-resolution tasks.
The cell-based encoding space is similar to the block-based
one, and can be regarded as a special case of the block-
based space where all the blocks are the same. The ENAS
algorithms employing this space build the architectures by
stacking repeated motifs. Chu et al. [129] divided the cell-based
space into two independent parts: the micro part containing the
parameters of cells, and the macro part deﬁning the connections
between different cells. To be more speciﬁc, the cell-based
encoding space concentrates more on the micro part. Different
from the block-based space, the layers in the cell can be
combined more freely, and the macro part is always determined
by human expertise [36], [142], [143]. Some widely used
encoding spaces are classiﬁed in this category. For example,
NAS-Bench-101 [142] and NAS-Bench-201 [143] search for
different combinations of layers and connections in cells, and
then stacked the cells sequentially. In addition, NASNet [144]
and DARTS [145] search for two kinds of cells, namely normal
cell and reduction cell, and each stacked cell is connected to
the two previous cells. The cell-based space greatly reduces
the size of the encoding space. This is because all the basic
units in the encoding space are the same, and the number of
parameters in terms of constructing the promising DNN is
much fewer. However, Frachon et al. [76] claimed that there
is no theoretical basis for that the cell-based space can help to
obtain a good architecture.
In contrast, the topology-based space does not consider the
parameters or the structure of each unit (layer or block), yet
they are only concerned about the connections between units.
One classical example is the one-shot method which treats all
the architectures as different subgraphs of a supergraph [26].
Yang et al. [137] proposed CARS to search for the architecture
by choosing different connections in the supergraph, and then
the architecture was built by the chosen subgraph. CARS
can be classiﬁed into the topology-based category because
it aims at deciding whether or not to keep the connections
in the supergraph. But from the perspective of building the
architecture, CARS can also be classiﬁed into the cell-based
category. This is because the subgraph cell was stacked several
times to build the architecture. Another typical case is pruning.
Wu et al. [133] employed a shallow VGGNet [8] on CIFAR-10,
and the aim was to prune unimportant weight connections from
the VGGNet.
As observed from Table II, the constraints on the encod-
ing space mainly focus on three aspects: ﬁxed depth, rich
initialization and partial ﬁxed structure. The ﬁxed depth means
all the individuals in the population have the same depth.
The ﬁxed depth is a strong constraint and largely reduces
the size of the encoding space. Please note that the ﬁxed
depth is different from the ﬁxed-length encoding strategy which
will be introduced in Section IV. In Genetic CNN [35], for
example, the ﬁxed-length encoding strategy only limits the
maximum depth. The node which is isolated (no connection)
is simply ignored. By this way, the individuals can obtain
different depths. The second constraint is rich initialization
(i.e., the well-designed space to be discussed in Section III-B),
and it is also a limitation in practice that requires a lot of
expertise. In this case, the initialized architectures are manually
designed, which goes against the original intention of NAS.
The partial ﬁxed structure means the architecture is partially
settled. For example, in [64], a max-pooling layer is added to
the network after every set of four convolution layers.
In Table II, the relatively few constraints category means
that those methods have no restrictions like the three aspects
discussed above. However, it does not imply there is no
constraint. For example, in the classiﬁcation task, the fully-
connected layer is often used as the tail of the whole DNNs
in some methods [21], [82], [127]. Moreover, the maximum
length is predeﬁned in many methods including both ﬁxed-
length encoding strategy methods [35] and variable-length

encoding strategy methods [21] resulting in preventing the
method from discovering a deeper architecture. Wang et al. [75]
tried to break the limit of maximum length by using a Gaussian
distribution initialization mechanism. Irwin et al. [146] broke
the limit by using the evolutionary operators, the crossover
operator and the mutation operator, to extend the depth to any
size.
Generally, the encoding space can be served as the basis of
the search space and the initial space. In practice, the encoding
space is often the same as the search space, while the initial
space is often a subspace of the encoding space. Fig. 6 shows
the relationship between the three spaces. The search space
is larger than the initial space when some manual constraints
are added to the population initialization. When there is no
such manual constrains, search space and initial space are
equivalent. Furthermore, the initial space determines what kind
of individuals may appear in the initial population, and the
search space determines what kind of individuals may appear
in the evolutionary search process, as illustrated in Fig. 2. In
the following subsections, we will discuss the initial space and
the search space in Subsections III-B and III-C, respectively.
B. Initial Space
In general, there are three types of architecture initialization
approaches in the initial space: starting from trivial initial con-
ditions [23], randomly initialization in the encoding space [21]
and staring from a well-designed architecture (also termed
as rich initialization) [34]. These three types of initialization
correspond to three different initial spaces: trivial space,
random space and well-designed space.
The trivial space contains only a few primitive layers. For
example, the LargeEvo algorithm [23] initialized the population
in a trivial space where each individual constitutes just a single-
layer model with no convolutions. Xie et al. [35] experimentally
demonstrated that a trivial space can evolve to a competitive
architecture. The reason for using as little experience as possible
is to justify the advantage of EC-based methods where some
novel architectures can be discovered, and most of the discovery
is different from the manually designed DNN architectures.
On the contrary, the well-designed space contains the state-
of-the-art architectures. In this way, a promising architecture
can be obtained at the beginning of the evolution, whereas
it can hardly evolve to other novel architectures. Actually,
many of ENAS methods adopting this initial space focus on
improving the performance upon the well-designed architecture.
For example, the architecture pruning aims at compressing
DNNs by removing less important connections [134]. For a
random space, all the individuals in the initial population
are randomly generated in the limited space, and it has been
adopted by many methods, such as [9], [21], [67]. The aim of
this type of initial spaces is also to reduce the intervention of
human experience in the initial population.
C. Search Space
After the initialization of the population, the ENAS methods
start to search the architectures in the search space. Generally
speaking, the search space is the same as the initial space when
the random initial space is adopted. For other two types of
initial spaces, however, due to the relatively small initial space,
the search space will become much larger with the expectation
that the promising architecture is included. It is worth noting
that many methods do not directly deﬁne the search space, but
restrict the search space by using evolutionary operators. For
example, Irwin et al. [146] did not specify the maximal depth,
instead, they used the evolutionary operations to extend the
architecture to any depth.
IV. ENCODING STRATEGY
This section will discuss how to encode a network architec-
ture into an individual of the EC methods. Each ENAS method
needs to determine its encoding strategy before starting the ﬁrst
stage of the ENAS method, i.e., the population initialization.
The most intuitive difference in different encoding strategies
of ENAS methods is the length of the encoded individuals.
Generally, the encoding strategies can be divided into two
different categories according to whether the length of an
individual changes or not during the evolutionary process.
They are the ﬁxed-length encoding strategy and the variable-
length encoding strategy. Particularly, the individuals have the
same length during the evolutionary process when the ﬁxed-
length encoding strategy is used. In contrast, the individuals
are with different lengths during the evolutionary process if the
variable-length encoding strategy is employed. The advantage
of the ﬁxed-length encoding strategy is that it is easy to use
standard evolutionary operations which are originally designed
for the individuals with equal lengths. In Genetic CNN [35], for
example, the ﬁxed-length binary string helped the evolutionary
operators (especially the crossover) with easy implementation.
Another example is [115], where Loni et al. used a ﬁxed-length
string of genes to represent the architecture which led to easy
implementation of the one-point crossover in the corresponding
encoded information. However, a proper maximal length must
be predeﬁned for the ﬁxed-length encoding strategy. Because
the maximal length relates to the optimal depth of the DNN
architecture, which is unknown in advance, the corresponding
ENAS algorithms still rely on expertise and experience.
Compared with the ﬁxed-length encoding strategy, the
variable-length encoding strategy dose not require the human
expertise regarding the optimal depth in advance, which has the
potential to be fully automated. In addition, the advantage of
this encoding strategy is that it can deﬁne more details of the
architecture with freedom. For example, when solving a new
task where there is no expertise in knowing the optimal depth of
the DNN, we just initialize the individuals with a random depth,
and the optimal depth can be found through the variable-length
encoding strategy, where the depths of the corresponding DNN
can be changed during the evolutionary process. However, the
variable-length encoding strategy also brings some drawbacks.
Because the traditional evolutionary operators might not be
suitable for this kind of encoding strategy, the corresponding

evolutionary operators need to be redesigned, where an example
can be seen in [21]. Another disadvantage is that, due to the
ﬂexibility of variable length encoding, it could generally result
in over-depth architectures, which sometimes further leads to
more time-consuming ﬁtness evaluation. Please note that some
works claimed their use of the variable-length encoding strategy,
where each individual is designed with a maximal length, and
then the placeholder is used to indicate the gene’s validation of
the gene [97]. For example, the individual is designed to have
1, 000 genes, while some genes having the values of zeros do
not participate in the evolutionary process. In this paper, we
also categorize these methods into the ﬁxed-length encoding
strategy.
In addition, most of the DNN architectures can be represented
as directed graphs which are made up of different basic units
and the connections between the units. Therefore, the encoding
for architecture can be divided into two aspects: conﬁgurations
of basic units and connections, which will be discussed in the
following subsections.
A. Encoding for Conﬁgurations of Basic Units
In practice, different basic units have different conﬁgurations,
such as layers, blocks and cells, which are demonstrated
in Section III. For example, in CNNs, there are multiple
parameters in the primitive layers which can be seen in Table I.
As for the DenseBlock implemented by Sun et al. [9], only
two parameters are needed to build the block. Because the
conﬁguration of cell is more ﬂexible than that of blocks in
CNNs, which can be regarded as a microcosm of a complete
neural network. For example, the cells in [36] are made up by
a combination of 10 layers selected from 8 different primitive
layers. But the cells do not include some of the conﬁgurations
of primitive layer, such as the feature map size which is an
important parameter in the primitive layer [21].
B. Encoding for Connections
When the parameters (conﬁgurations) of the basic units
in the architecture have been determined, the corresponding
architecture cannot be built up immediately. Since edges are
indispensable in directed graph, connections are also part of
the architecture. The connections discussed in this section
include not only connections between basic units, but also the
connections within the basic units.
Generally, the architectures of neural networks can be
divided into two categories: linear architecture and non-linear
architecture. The former denotes the architectures containing
sequential basic units. The latter indicates that there are skip-
connections or loop-connections in the architecture. Please note
that, the structure could be the macro structure consisting of
basic units, or the micro structure within the basic units.
1) Linear Architecture: The linear architecture can be found
in different kinds of architectures including the one generated
from the layer-based encoding space and the block-based
encoding space. Its widespread use in ENAS stems from its
simplicity. No matter how complex the internal of the basic
units is, many ENAS methods stack the basic units one by one
to build up the skeleton of the architecture which is linear. For
example, in AE-CNN [9], Sun et al. stacked different kinds of
blocks to generate the architecture.
One special case is a linear architecture generated from the
layer-based encoding space. In this case, there is no need to
solely encode the connections, and only the parameters in each
basic unit are enough to build an architecture. One classical
example can be seen in [21] where Sun et al. explored a great
number of parameters based on a linear CNN architecture.
However, most architectures are not designed to be linear. The
skip connections in ResNet [2] and the dense connections in
DenseNet [3] show the ability to build a good architecture.
2) Non-linear Architecture: Firstly, we will introduce two
approaches to encoding a non-linear architecture in this subsec-
tion. Speciﬁcally, the adjacent matrix is the most popular way to
represent the connections for non-linear architectures. Genetic
CNN [35] used a binary string to represent the connection,
and the string can be transformed into a triangular matrix.
In the binary string, “1” denotes that there is a connection
between the two nodes while “0” denotes no connection in
between. Lorenzo et al. [135] used a matrix to represent the
skip connections, and this work revolved around the adjacent
matrix. Back in the 1990s, Kitano et al. [147] began to study
the use of the adjacent matrix to represent network connection
and explained the process from the connectivity matrix, to
the bit-string genotype, to the network architecture phenotype.
Another way to represent the connections is to use an ordered
pair G = (V, E) with vertices V and edge E associated with
a direction, to represent a directed acyclic graph. Irwin et
al. [146] also used this strategy to encode the connections.
Secondly, the non-linear architecture is a more common
case in both the macro architecture and the micro architecture.
AmoebaNet-A [36], as an example of non-linear macro
architecture, stacked these two kinds of cells for several times
to build up an architecture. In addition, each cell receives two
inputs from the previous two cells separately, which means that
the direct connection and the skip-connection are both used in
this macro structure. Also in AmoebaNet, each cell is a non-
linear architecture inside, which means the micro architecture
is also non-linear. The non-linear architecture provides the
architecture with more ﬂexibility, which makes it more likely
to build up a promising architecture than that of the linear
ones.
V. POPULATION UPDATING
This section discusses the population updating process as
shown in Fig. 2. Generally, the population updating varies
greatly among existing ENAS algorithms because they may
employ different EC methods which are with different updating
mechanisms. Table III shows the ENAS algorithms which are
classiﬁed according to the EC methods that they employ and
different types of DNNs that they target at. Obviously, the
EA-based ENAS algorithms dominate the ENAS. To be more
speciﬁc, the GA-based ENAS is the most popular approach
which largely owes to the convenience of architecture repre-
sentation in GA. As a result, we give a detailed introduction
to the EA-based ENAS including the selection strategy at
ﬁrst. Immediately after, we present a summary of the SI-based

A. EAs for ENAS
The dash box in Fig. 2 shows the general ﬂow of population
updating in EA-based ENAS. In this section, we will introduce
the selection strategy and the evolutionary operations which
collectively update the population. Speciﬁcally, the ﬁrst stage
of population updating is selection. The selection strategies can
be classiﬁed into several types, where Table IV shows the main
kinds of selection strategies. Note that the selection strategy can
be not only used in choosing individuals as parents to generate
offspring with the evolutionary operators, but also used in the
environmental selection stage which chooses individuals to
make up the next population. Zhang et al. [104] termed these
two selections as mate selection and environmental selection
separately.
Existing selection strategies can be divided into ﬁve cate-
gories: elitism, discarding the worst, roulette wheel selection,
tournament selection and others. The simplest strategy is elitism
which retains the individuals with higher ﬁtness. However, this
can cause a loss of diversity in the population, which may
lead the population falling into local optima. Discarding the
worst is similar to elitism, which removes the individuals with
poor ﬁtness values from the population. Real et al. [36] used
the aging evolution which discards the oldest individual in the
population. Aging evolution can explore the search space more,
instead of zooming in on good models too early, as non-aging
evolution would. The same selection strategy was also used
in [40]. Zhu et al. [60] combined these two approaches to
discarding the worst individual and the oldest individual at
the same time. Roulette wheel selection gives every individual
a probability according to its ﬁtness among the population
to survive (or be discarded), regardless it is the best or not.
Tournament selection selects the best one from an equally likely
sampling of individuals. Furthermore, Johner et al. [61] used
a ranking function to choose individuals by rank. A selection
trick termed as niching was used in [71], [128] to avoid stacking
into local optima. This trick allows offspring worse than parent
to survive for several generations until evolving to a better one.
Most of the methods focus on preserving the well-performed
individuals, however, Liu et al. [126] emphasized the genes
more than the survived individuals, where a gene can represent
any components in the architecture. They believed the individ-
uals which consist of the ﬁne-gene set are more likely to have
promising performance.
Some selection methods aim at preserving the diversity of the
population. Elsken et al. [105] selected individuals in inverse
proportion to their density. Javaheripi et al. [178] chose the
parents based on the distance (difference) during the mate
selection. They chose two individuals with the highest distance
to promote the exploration search.
In terms of evolutionary operations, mutation and crossover
are two of the most commonly used operations in EA-based
ENAS algorithms. Particularly, the mutation is only performed
on a single individual, while the crossover takes two individuals
to generate offspring.
The mutation operator aims to search the global optimum
around the individual. A simple idea is to allow the encoded
information to vary from a given range. Sun et al. [21] used the
polynomial mutation [179] on the parameters of layers which


---

<!-- Page 9 -->

are expressed by real numbers. To make mutation not random,
Lorenzo et al. [135] proposed a novel Gaussian mutation
based on a Gaussian regression to guide the mutation, i.e.,
the Gaussian regression can predict which architecture may
be good, and the newly generated individuals are sampled in
the regions of the search space, where the ﬁtness values are
likely to be high. This makes mutation to have a “direction”.
Moreover, Maziarz et al. [180] used an RNN to guide the
mutation operation. In this work, the mutation operations were
not sampled at random among the possible architectural choices,
but were sampled from distributions inferred by an RNN. Using
an RNN to control the mutation operation can also be seen in
other methods such as [129]. Some researches investigated the
diversity of the population after mutation. Qiang et al. [39] used
a variable mutation probability. They used a higher probability
in the early stage for better exploration and a lower probability
in the later stage for better exploitation. It has been effectively
applied to many other methods [70]. To maintain the diversity
of the population after the mutation operation, Tian et al. [67]
used force mutation and distance calculation, which ensures
the individual in the population is not particularly similar to
other individuals (especially the best one). Kramer et al. [128]
used the (1+1)-evolutionary strategy that generates an offspring
based on a single parent with bit-ﬂip mutation, and used a
mutation rate to control and niching to overcome local optima.
The intensive computational cost of ENAS presents a
bottleneck which will be discussed in later sections. To reduce
the unaffordable computational cost and time, some kinds of the
mutation have also been designed. Zhang et al. [104] proposed
an exchange mutation which exchanges the position of two
genes of the individual, i.e., exchanging the order of layers. This
will not bring new layers and the weights in neural networks
can be completely preserved, which means that the offspring
do not have to be trained from scratch. Chen et al. [181]
introduced two function-preserving operators for DNNs, and
these operators are termed as network morphisms [182]. The
network morphisms aim to change the DNN architecture
without the loss of the acquired experience. The network
morphisms change the architecture from F(·) to G(·), which
satisﬁes the condition formulated by Equation (2):
∀x,
F(x) = G(x)
(2)
where x denotes the input of the DNN. The network morphisms
can be regarded as a function-preserving mutation operation.
With this operation, the mutated individuals will not have
worse performance than their parents. To be more speciﬁc,
Chen et al. [181] proposed net2widernet to obtain a wider net
and net2deepernet to obtain a deeper net. Elsken et al. [32]
extended the network morphisms with two popular network
operations: skip connections and batch normalization. Zhu
et al. [60] proposed ﬁve well-designed function-preserving
mutation operations to guide the evolutionary process by the
information which have already learned. To avoid local optimal,
Chen et al. [123] added noises in some function-preserving
mutation, and in the experiment, they found that by adding
noises to pure network morphism, instead of compromising
the efﬁciency, it by contrast, improved the ﬁnal classiﬁcation
accuracy. Please note that all the network morphisms can
only increase the capacity of a network because if one
would decrease the network’s capacity, the function-preserving
property could not be guaranteed [105]. As a result, the
architecture generated by network morphisms is only going to
get larger and deeper, which is not suitable for a device with
limited computing resources, such as a mobile phone. In order
for the network architecture to be reduced, Elsken et al. [105]
proposed the approximate network morphism, which satisﬁes
Equation (3):
∀x,
F(x) ≈G(x)
(3)
For the crossover operator, the single-point crossover [183]
is the most popular method in EA-based ENAS [48], [64], [66],
[134] because of its implementation simplicity. However, single-
point crossover can typically apply to two individuals with
equal lengths only. Therefore, this cannot be applied to variable-
length individuals. To this end, Sun et al. [24] proposed an
efﬁcient crossover operator for individuals with variable lengths.
Sapra et al. [79] proposed a disruptive crossover swapping the
whole cluster (a sequence of layers) between both individuals
at the corresponding positions rather than only focusing on
the parameters of layers. Sun et al. [21] used the Simulated
Binary Crossover (SBX) [184] to do a combination of the
encoded parameters from two matched layers. Please note that
the encoded parameters after SBX are not the same as that of
both parents, which are quite different from other crossover
operators.
EAs for multi-objective ENAS is gaining more and more
attention from researchers. The single objective ENAS algo-
rithms are always concerned about only one objective, e.g.,
the classiﬁcation accuracy, and these algorithms have only one
goal: searching for the architecture with the highest accuracy.
In general, most of the multi-objective ENAS algorithms aim
at dealing with both the performance of the neural network and
the number of parameters simultaneously [101], [105], [137],
[170]. However, these objective functions are often in conﬂict
with each other. For example, getting a higher accuracy often
requires a more complicated architecture with the need of more
computational resources. On the contrary, a device with limited
computational resource, e.g., a mobile phone, cannot afford
such sophisticated architectures.
The simplest way to tackle the multi-objective optimization
problem is by converting it into a single objective optimization
problem with weighting factors, i.e., the weighted summation
method. The Equation (4)
F = λf1 + (1 −λ)f2
(4)
is the classical linear form to weight two objective functions
f1, f2 into a single objective function, where the λ ∈(0, 1)
denotes the weighting factor. In [65], [83], [113], [185], the
multi-objective optimization problem was solved by using the
available single objective optimization methods by Equation (4)
of the weighted summation. Chen et al. [130] did not adopt
the linear addition as the objective function, whereas using a
nonlinear penalty term. However, the weights manually deﬁned
may incur bias [186].

Some algorithms have been designed and widely used in
multi-objective optimization, such as NSGA-II [187], and
MOEA/D [188], which have been also used in ENAS methods
such as [107], [115], [169]. These methods aim to ﬁnd a
Pareto-font set (or non-dominant set). Only these methods are
in the multi-objective category of Table III. Some researches
have made improvements on these multi-objective optimiza-
tion methods for better use in ENAS. Baldeon et al. [107]
chose the penalty based boundary intersection approach in
MOEA/D because training a neural network involves noncon-
vex optimization and the form of Pareto Font is unknown.
LEMONADE [105] divided the objective function into two
categories: fexp and fcheap. fexp denotes the expensive-to-
evaluate objectives (e.g., the accuracy), while fcheap denotes
the cheap-to-evaluate objectives (e.g., the model size). In every
iteration, they sampled parent networks with respect to sparsely
distribution based on the cheap objectives fcheap to generate
offspring. Therefore, they evaluated fcheap more times than
fexp to save time. Schoron et al. [81] also took the use of
the LEMONADE proposed by Elsken et al. [105]. Due to
that NSGA-III [189] may fall into the small model trap (this
algorithm prefers small models), Yang et al. [137] have made
some improvements to the conventional NSGA-III for favoring
larger models.
B. SI for ENAS
PSO is inspired by the bird ﬂocking or ﬁsh schooling [16],
and is easy to implement compared with other SI algorithms.
Junior et al. [74] used their implementation of PSO to update
the particles based on the layer instead of the parameters of the
layer. Gao et al. [165] developed a gradient-priority particle
swarm optimization algorithm to handle issues including the
low convergence efﬁciency of PSO when there are a large
number of hyper-parameters to be optimized. They expected
the particle to ﬁnd the locally optimal solution at ﬁrst, and
then move to the global optimal solution.
For ACO, the individuals are generated in a quite different
way. Several ants are in an ant colony4. Each ant moves from
node to node following the pheromone instructions to build
an architecture. The pheromone is updated every generation.
The paths of well-performed architecture will maintain more
pheromone to attract the next ant for exploitation and at the
same time, the pheromone is also decaying (i.e., pheromone
evaporation), which encourages other ants to explore other
areas. Byla et al. [106] let the ants choose the path from
the node to node in a graph whose depth increases gradually.
Elsaid et al. [163] introduced different ant agent types to act
according to speciﬁc roles to serve the needs of the colony,
which is inspired by the real ants species.
SI for multi-objective ENAS started only in the last two
years and the research of this ﬁeld is scarce which can be seen
from Table III. Li et al. [51] used the bias-variance framework
on their proposed multi-objective PSO to get a more accurate
and stable architecture. Wu et al. [133] used the MOPSO [190]
for neural networks pruning. The Gbest is selected according to
the crowding distance in the non-dominant solutions set. Wang
4The population in ACO also termed as colony.
et al. [109] used the OMOPSO [191], which selects the leaders
using a crowding factor and the Gbest is selected from the
leaders. To better control the balance between convergence and
diversity, Jiang et. al. [92] proposed a MOPSO/D algorithm
based on an adaptive penalty-based boundary intersection.
C. Other EC Techniques for ENAS
Different from GAs, the mutation of DE exploits the
information from three individuals. Some ENAS methods
like [52], [90] chose DE to guide the offspring generation.
However, there is little difference between different DE-based
ENAS algorithms.
Wang et al. [192] proposed a hybrid PSO-GA method. They
used PSO to guide the evolution of the parameters in each
block encoded in decimal notation. Meanwhile, using GA to
guide the evolution of the shortcut connections is encoded in
binary notation. Because PSO performs well on continuous
optimization and GA is suitable for optimization with binary
values, this hybrid method can search architectures effectively.
HCA can be interpreted as a very simple evolutionary
algorithm. For example, in [32] the evolutionary operators
only contain mutation and no crossover, and the selection
strategy is relatively simple. The memetic algorithm is the
hybrids of EAs and local search. Evans et al. [167] integrated
the local search (as gradient descent) into GP as a ﬁne-tuning
operation. The CVOA [88] was inspired by the new respiratory
virus, COVID-19. The architecture was found by simulating the
virus spreads and infecting healthy individuals. Hyper-heuristic
contains two levels: high-level strategy and low-level heuristics,
and a domain barrier is between these two levels. Hence the
high-level strategy is still useful when the application domain is
changed. AIS was inspired by theories related to the mammal
immune system and do not require the crossover operator
compared to the GA [76].
VI. EFFICIENT EVALUATION
In this section, we will discuss the strategies to improve
the efﬁciency of evaluations, with the consideration that the
evaluation is often the most time-consuming stage of ENAS
algorithms [193].
Real et al. [23] used 250 computers to ﬁnish the LargeEvo
algorithm over 11 days. Such computational resources are
not available for everyone interested in NAS. Almost all
of the methods evaluate individuals by training them ﬁrst
and evaluating them on the validation/test dataset. Since the
architecture is becoming more and more complex, it will take
a lot of time for training each architecture to convergence.
So it is needed to investigate new methods to shorten the
evaluation time and reduce the dependency on large amounts
of computational resources. Table V lists ﬁve of the most
common methods to reduce the time: weight inheritance, early
stopping policy, reduced training set, reduced population, and
population memory. We would like to introduce the ﬁve kinds
of methods ﬁrst, then other kinds of promising methods next,
and ﬁnally the surrogate-assisted methods at the end of this
section.

Because the evolutionary operators do not completely disrupt
the architecture of an individual, some parts of the newly
generated individuals are the same as their parents. The weights
of the same parts can be easily inherited. With the weight
inheritance, the neural networks no longer need to be trained
completely from scratch. This method has been used in [166]
20 years ago. Moreover, as mentioned in Section V, the network
morphisms change the network architecture without loss of the
acquired experience. This could be regarded as the ultimate
weight inheritance because it solved the weight inheritance
problem in the changed architecture part. The ultimate weight
inheritance lets the new individual completely inherit the
knowledge from their parents, which will save a lot of time.
The early stopping policy is another method which has been
used widely in NAS. The simplest way is to set a ﬁxed and
relatively small number of training epochs. This method is used
in [25], where training the individuals after a small number
of epochs is sufﬁcient. Similarly, Assunccao et al. [82] let the
individuals undergo the training for the same and short time
each epoch (although this time is not ﬁxed and will increase
with the epoch), to allow the promising architectures have more
training time to get a more precise evaluation, So et al. [194] set
hurdles after a ﬁxed number of epochs. The weak individuals
stop training early to save time. However, the early stopping
policy can lead to inaccurate estimation about individuals’
performance (especially the large and complicated architecture),
which can be seen in Fig. 7. In Fig. 7, individual2 performs
better than individual1 before epoch t1, whereas individual1
performs better in the end. Yang et al. [137] also discussed
this phenomenon. So, it is crucial to determine at which point
to stop. Note that neural networks can converge or hardly
improve its performance after several epochs, as seen in the t1
for individual2 and the t2 for individual1 in Fig. 7. Using the
performance estimated at this point can evaluate an individual’s
relatively accurately with less training time. Therefore, some
methods such as [34], [89] stopped training when observing
there is no signiﬁcant performance improvement. Suganuma et
al. [116] used the early stopping policy based on a reference
curve. If the accuracy curve of an individual is under the
reference curve for successive epochs, then the training will be
terminated and this individual is regarded as a poor one. After
every epoch, the reference curve is updated by the accuracy
curve of the best offspring.
The reduced training set, i.e., using a subset of data that
assuming similar properties to a large dataset, can also shorten
the time effectively. Liu et al. [126] explored promising
architectures by training on a subset and used transfer learning
on the large original dataset. Because there are so many
benchmark datasets in the image classiﬁcation ﬁeld, the
architecture can be evaluated on a smaller dataset (e.g., CIFAR-
10) ﬁrst and then applied on a large dataset (such as CIFAR-100
and ImageNet [195]). The smaller dataset can be regarded as
the proxy for the large one.
The reduced population is a unique method of ENAS since
other NAS approaches do not have a population. Assunccao
et al. [99] reduced the population based on their previous
algorithm [196], [197] to speed up the evolution. However,
simply reducing the population may not explore the search

space well in each epoch and may lose the global search
ability. Another way is reducing the population dynamically.
For instance, Fan et al. [124] used the (µ+λ) evolution strategy
and divided the evolution into three stages with the population
reduction, which aims to ﬁnd the balance between the limited
computing resources and the efﬁciency of the evolution. The
large population in the ﬁrst stage is to ensure the global search
ability, while the small population in the last stage is to shorten
the evolution time. Instead of reducing the population, Liu et
al. [198] evaluated the downsizing architecture with smaller
size at an early stage of evolution. Similarly, Wang et al. [131]
did not evaluate the whole architecture but starting with a single
block, and then the blocks were stacked to build architecture
as evolution proceeds.
The population memory is another category of the unique
methods of ENAS. It works by reusing the corresponding
architectural information that has previously appeared in the
population. In the population-based methods, especially the
GA based methods (e.g., in [21]), it is natural to maintain
well-performed individuals in the population in successive
generations. Sometimes, the individuals in the next population
directly inherit all the architecture information of their parents
without any modiﬁcation, so it is not necessary to evaluate the
individuals again. Fujino et al. [34] used memory to record the
ﬁtness of individuals, and if the same architecture encoded in an
individual appears, the ﬁtness value is retrieved from memory
instead of being reevaluated. Similarly, Miahi et al. [119] and
Sun et al. [24] employed a hashing method for saving pairs of
architecture and ﬁtness of each individual and reusing them
when the same architecture appears again. Johner et al. [61]
prohibited the appearance of architectures that have appeared
before offspring generation. This does reduce the time, however,
the best individuals are forbidden to remain in the population
which may lead the population evolve towards a bad direction.
There are many other well-performed methods to reduce
the time in ENAS. Rather than training thousands of different
architectures, one-shot model [199] trained only one SuperNet

to save time. Different architectures, i.e., the SubNets, are
sampled from the SuperNet with the shared parameters. Yang
et al. [137] believed the traditional ENAS methods without
using SuperNet which were less efﬁcient for models to be
optimized separately. In contrast, the one-shot model optimizes
the architecture and the weights alternatively. But the weight
sharing mechanism brings difﬁculty in accurately evaluating
the architecture. Chu et al. [200] scrutinized the weight-
sharing NAS with a fairness perspective and demonstrated
the effectiveness. However, there remain some doubts that
cannot explain clearly in the one-shot model. The weights in
the SuperNet are coupled. It is unclear why inherited weights
for a speciﬁc architecture are still effective [139].
Making the use of hardware can reduce the time, too. Jiang
et al. [92] used a distributed asynchronous system which
contained a major computing node with 20 individual workers.
Each worker is responsible for training a single block and
uploading its result to the major node in every generation.
Wang et al. [109] designed an infrastructure which has the
ability to leverage all of the available GPU cards across multiple
machines to concurrently perform the objective evaluations for
a batch of individuals. Colangelo et al. [201], [202] designed
a reconﬁgurable hardware framework that ﬁts the ENAS. As
they claimed, this was the ﬁrst work of conducting NAS and
hardware co-optimization.
Furthermore, Lu et al. [101] adopted the concept of proxy
models, which are small-scale versions of the intended archi-
tectures. For example, in a CNN architecture, the number of
layers and the number of channels in each layer are reduced.
However, the drawback of this method is obvious: the loss of
prediction accuracy. Therefore, they performed an experiment
to determine the smallest proxy model that can provide a
reliable estimate of performance at a larger scale.
All the above methods obtain the ﬁtness of individuals
by directly evaluating the performance on the validation
dataset. An alternative way is to use indirect methods, namely
the performance predictors. As summarized in [203], the
performance predictors can be divided into two categories:
performance predictors based on the learning curve and end-
to-end performance predictors, both of which are based on the
training-predicting learning paradigm. This does not mean the
performance predictor does not undergo the training phase at
all, while it means learning from the information obtained in
the training phase, and uses the knowledge learned to make a
reasonable prediction for other architectures. Ralwal et al. [157]
took the use of the learning curve based predictor, where the
ﬁtness is not calculated in the last epoch but is predicted by
the sequence of ﬁtness from ﬁrst epochs. Speciﬁcally, they
used a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) [204] as a sequence
to sequence model, predicting the ﬁnal performance by using
the learning results of the ﬁrst several epochs on the validation
dataset. Sun et al. [203] adopted a surrogate-assisted method
which is called end-to-end performance predictor. The predictor
does not need any extra information about the performance
of individuals to be evaluated. The performance predictor is
essentially a regression model mapping from the architecture
to its performance. The regression model needs to be trained
with sufﬁcient training data pairs ﬁrst, and each pair consists
of architecture and its corresponding performance. Speciﬁcally,
they chose random forest [205] as the regression model to
accelerate the ﬁtness evaluations in ENAS. When the random
forest receives a newly generated architecture as input, the
adaptive combination of a huge number of regression trees
which have been trained in advance in the forest gives the
prediction.
VII. APPLICATIONS
This section discussed different application ﬁelds of ENAS
has involved. Generally, the ENAS algorithms can be applied
to wherever DNNs can be applied. Table VI shows the wide
range of applications and Table VII displays the performance of
extraordinary ENAS methods on two popular and challenging
datasets for image classiﬁcation tasks, namely CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100. Both of these two tables can show what ENAS
has achieved so far.
A. Overview
Table VI shows the applications of existing ENAS algorithms,
which contains a wide range of real-world applications.
Generally, these applications can be grouped into the
following ﬁve different categories:
(1) Image and signal processing, including image clas-
siﬁcation which is the most popular and competitive ﬁeld,
image to image processing (including image restoration, image
denoising, super-resolution and image inpainting), emotion
recognition, speech recognition, language modelling, and face
de-identiﬁcation.
(2) Biological and biomedical tasks, including medical image
segmentation, malignant melanoma detection, sleep heart study,
and assessment of human sperm.
(3) Predictions and forecasting about all sorts of data,
including the prediction of wind speed, car park occupancy,
time-series data, ﬁnancial and usable life, the forecasting of
electricity demand time series, trafﬁc ﬂow, electricity price,
and municipal waste.
(4) Engineering, including engine vibration prediction, Un-
manned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), bearing fault diagnosis and
predicting general aviation ﬂight data.
(5) Others, including crack detection of concrete, gamma-
ray detection, multitask learning, identify galaxies, video
understanding, and comics understanding.
B. Comparisons on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet
In Table VI, it is obvious to see that many ENAS methods
are applied to the image classiﬁcation tasks. The benchmark
dataset, CIFAR-10 which contains a total of ten classes, and
the CIFAR-100 is the advanced dataset including a hundred
classes. These two datasets have been widely used in image
classiﬁcation tasks, and the accuracy on these two challenging
datasets can represent the ability of the architecture searched.
In addition, ImageNet [195] is a more challenging benchmark
dataset, which contains 1,000 classes and more than one million
images. Because CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are relatively small
and easy to be over-ﬁtting nowadays [122], the results of

the ENAS methods on ImageNet are also included. We have
collected the well-performed ENAS methods tested on these
three datasets and showed the results in Table VII, where the
methods are ranked in an ascending order of their best accuracy
on CIFAR-10, i.e., the methods are ranked in a descending
order of their error rate based on the conventions. The data
shown under column “CIFAR-10” and “CIFAR-100” denotes
the error rate of each method on the corresponding datasets.
Especially, as for ImageNet, we report both top1 and top5
error rates. Furthermore, the “GPU Days”, which was initially
proposed in [21], denotes the total search time of each method,
it can be calculated by Equation (5)
GPU Days = The number of GPUs × t
(5)
where the t denotes the number of days that each method
searched for. In Table VII “Parameters” denotes the total
number of parameters which can represent the capability of
architecture and the complexity. In addition, the symbol “—”
in Table VII implies there is no result publically reported by
the corresponding paper. The year reported in this table is its
earliest time made public. Furthermore, there are additional
notes provided for Table VII. Firstly, if there are several
results reported from literature, such as CGP-DCNN [113]
and CARS [137], we choose to report one or two of the most
representative architectures. Secondly, we name two algorithms
without proper names in Table VII (i.e., Fireﬂy-CNN [77]
and EEDNAS-NNMM [123]) based on the EC methods they
used and the ﬁrst letter of the title. Thirdly, we report the
classiﬁcation errors of CGP-CNN [116] in the format of “best
(mean ± std)”. Finally, the symbols of “+” and “-” in the
column of “GPU Days” denote the meaning of “more than”
and “less than”, respectively.
In principle, there is no totally fair comparison. Due to
the following two reasons: (1) The encoding space including
the initial space and the search space is different from each
other. There are two extreme cases in the initial space: trivial
initialization which starts at the simplest architecture and rich
initialization which starts from a well-designed architecture
(e.g., ResNet-50 [2]). Meanwhile the size of the search space is
largely different, e.g., Ref [48] only takes the kernel size into
the search space. (2) Different tricks exploited in the methods,
e.g., the “cutout”, can make the comparisons unfair, too. The
“cutout” refers to a regularization method [216] used in the
training of CNNs, which could improve the ﬁnal performance
appreciably.
Table VII shows the progress of ENAS for image classiﬁ-
cation according to the accuracy on CIFAR-10: LargeEvo
algorithm [23] (5.4%, 2017), LEMONADE [105] (2.58%,
2018), and NSGANet [101] (2.02%, 2019). Many ENAS
methods have a lower error rate than ResNet-110 [2] with
6.43% error rate on CIFAR-10, which is a manually well-
designed architecture. Therefore, the architecture found by
ENAS can reach the same level or exceed the architecture
designed by experts. It shows that the ENAS is reliable and
can be used in other application ﬁelds.
VIII. CHALLENGES AND ISSUES
Despite the positive results of the existing ENAS methods,
there are still some challenges and issues which need to be
addressed. In the following, we will brieﬂy discuss them.
A. The Effectiveness
The effectiveness of ENAS is questioned by many re-
searchers. Wistuba et al. [27] noticed that the random search
can get a well-performed architecture and has proven to be an
extremely strong baseline. Yu et al. [217] showed the state-
of-the-art NAS algorithms performed similarly to the random
policy on average. Liashchynskyi et al. [218] compared with
grid search, random search, and GA for NAS, which showed
that the architecture obtained by GA and random search have
similar performance. There is no need to use complicated
algorithms to guide the search process if random search can
outperform NAS based on EC approaches.
However, the evolutionary operator in [218] only contains
a recombination operator, which limited the performance of
ENAS algorithms. Although random search can ﬁnd a well-
performed architecture in the experiments, it cannot guarantee

that it will ﬁnd a good architecture every time. Moreover,
recent researches [100], [139] also showed the evolutionary
search was more effective than random search. Furthermore, the
experiments in Amoebanet [36] and NAS-Bench-201 [143] also
showed that ENAS can search for and ﬁnd better architectures.
Thus, there is an urgent need to design an elaborated experiment
to reveal what components in ENAS are responsible for the
effectiveness of the algorithm, especially in a large encoding
space.
In Section V, two types of operators have been introduced.
We note that some methods like the LargeEvo algorithm [23]
only use single individual based operator (mutation) to generate
offspring. The main reason that they did not involve the
crossover operator in their method come from two reasons: the
ﬁrst is for simplicity [174], and the second is that simply
combining a section of one individual with a section of
another individual seems “ill-suited” to the neural network
paradigm [76]. Secondly in [27], the authors believed that
there was no indication that a recombination operation applied
to two individuals with high ﬁtness would result in an offspring
with similar or better ﬁtness.
However, the supplemental materials in [24] demonstrated


---

<!-- Page 15 -->

the effectiveness of the crossover operator in this method.
This method can ﬁnd a good architecture with the help of
the crossover operation. On the contrary, when crossover
is not used, the architecture found is not promising, unless
it runs for a long time. In fact, the mutation operator let
an individual explore the neighbouring region, and it is a
gradually incremental search process like searching step by step.
Crossover (recombination) can generate offspring dramatically
different from the parents, which is more likely a stride. So,
this operator has the ability to efﬁciently ﬁnd a promising
architecture. Chu et al. [121] preferred that while a crossover
mainly contributes to exploitation, a mutation is usually aimed
to introduce exploration. These two operators play different
roles in the evolutionary process. But there is not a sufﬁcient
explanation of how the crossover operator works. Maybe some
additional experiments need to be done on the methods without
the crossover operator.
The EC approach generally performs well when dealing with
practical problems (e.g., the vehicle routing problem). This
is mainly because EC is designed collectively by considering
the domain knowledge in most cases [219], [220]. Similarly,
another key reason to ensure the effectiveness of the ENAS
algorithm is that the EC approach can effectively consider (and
embed) some domain knowledge of the neural architecture.
Since the original intention of ENAS is to design neural
architectures automatically without manual experience, the
future development of ENAS will need to continue to reduce
any artiﬁcial experience by including prior knowledge of the
encoding space. In this case, how to effectively embed domain
knowledge into ENAS is a big challenge.
B. Scalability
The scale of the datasets used in most ENAS methods is
relatively large. Taking the image classiﬁcation task as an
example, the MNIST dataset [221] is one of the earliest datasets.
In total, it contains 70, 000 28 × 28 grayscale images. Later
in 2009, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 [13] including 60, 000
32 × 32 color images are medium-scale datasets. One of
the most well-known large-scale datasets is ImageNet [195],
which provides more than 14 million manually annotated high-
resolution images. Unlike CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, which
are commonly used in ENAS, fewer methods choose to verify
their performance on ImageNet [122], [134], [180]. This can
be explained by the data shown in Table VII, where the GPU
Days are usually tens or even thousands. It is unaffordable for
most researchers when the medium-scale dataset changes to
the lager one.
However, Chen et al. [122] believed that the results on the
larger datasets like ImageNet are more convincing because
CIFAR-10 is easy to be over-ﬁtting. A popular way to deal
with this is using a proxy on CIFAR-10 and transfers to
ImageNet [36], [105]. Another alternative approach is to
use the down-scaled dataset of a large-scale dataset such as
ImageNet64 × 64 [222].
C. Efﬁcient Evaluation Method and Reduce Computational
Cost
Section VI has introduced the most popular and effective
ways to reduce the ﬁtness evaluation time and the computational
cost. In a nutshell, it can be described as a question that strikes
the balance between the time spent and the accuracy of the
evaluation. Because of the unbearable time for fully training
the architecture, we must compromise as little as we can on
the evaluation accuracy in exchange for signiﬁcant reduction
in the evaluation time without sufﬁcient computing resources.
Although a lot of ENAS methods have adopted various
means to shorten the evaluation time. Even though Sun et
al. [203] speciﬁcally proposed a method for acceleration, the
research direction of search acceleration is just getting started.
The current approaches have many limitations that need to be
addressed. For example, although the LargeEvo algorithm [23]
used the weight inheritance to shorten the evaluation time
and reduced the computational cost, it still ran for several
days with the use of lots of computational resources which
cannot be easily accessed by many researchers. Furthermore,
there is no baseline and common assessment criteria for search
acceleration methods. It is a major challenge to propose a novel
method to evaluate the architecture accurately and quickly.
D. Interpretability
CNNs are known as black-box-like solutions, which are
hard to interpret [63]. Although some works have been done
to visualize the process of feature extraction [223], they are
uninterpretable due to a large number of learned features [154].
The low interpretability of the manual designed architecture
becomes a big obstacle to the development of neural networks.
To overcome this obstacle, some researches [63], [154], [167]
used GP to automatically design the neural network. Being
well-known for its potential interpretability, GP aims at solving
problems by automatically evolving computer programs [224].
All the above researches [63], [154], [167] gave a fur-
ther analysis to demonstrate the interpretability. Speciﬁcally,
Evans et al. [154] have made a visualization on the JAFFE
dataset [225] to expound how the evolved convolution ﬁlter
served as a form of edge detection, and the large presence
of white color in the output of the convolution can help
the classiﬁcation. In their subsequent work [167], they made
a visualization of the automatically evolved model on the
Hands dataset [226], where the aggregation function extracts
the minimum value of a speciﬁc area in the hand image to
determine whether the hand is open or closed. Furthermore, Bi
et al. [63] displayed the features described by the evolved
functions like convolution, max-pooling and addition, and
the generated salient features are discriminative for face
classiﬁcation.
Despite the interpretability the existing work made, all these
GP-based ENAS methods only aim at shallow NNs and the
number of the generated features is relatively small. However,
all the most successful NNs have a deep architecture. This is
due partly to the fact that very few GP based methods can be
run on GPUs. It is necessary to use deep-GP to evolve a deeper

GP tree and make a further analysis on the deeper architecture
in the future.
E. Future Applications
Table VI shows various applications which have been
explored by ENAS. But these are just a small part of all areas
of neural network applications. ENAS can be applied wherever
neural networks can be applied, and automate the process of
architecture designed which should have been done by experts.
Moreover, plenty of the image classiﬁcation successes of ENAS
have proven that ENAS has the ability to replace experts in
many areas. The automated architecture design is a trend.
However, this process is not completely automated. The
encoding space (search space) still needs to be designed by
experts for different applications. For example, for the image
processing tasks, CNNs are more suitable, so the encoding
space contains the layers including convolution layers, pooling
layers and fully connected layers. For the time-series data
processing, RNNs are more suitable, so the encoding space
may contain the cells including ∆-RNN cell, LSTM [204],
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) [227], Minimally-Gated Unit
(MGU) [228], and Update-Gated RNN (UGRNN) [229]. The
two manually determined encoding spaces already contain a
great deal of artiﬁcial experience and the components without
guaranteed performance are excluded. The problem is: can
a method search the corresponding type of neural network
for multiple tasks in a large encoding space, including all the
popular widely used components? Instead of searching one
multitask network [212] which learns several tasks at once
with the same neural network, the aim is to ﬁnd appropriate
networks for different tasks in one large encoding space.
F. Fair Comparisons
Section VII-B gives a brief introduction of the unfair
comparisons. The unfairness mainly comes from two aspects:
(1) the tricks including cutout [216], ScheduledDropPath [144],
etc. (2) The different encoding spaces. For aspect (1), some
ENAS methods [24] have reported the results with and without
the tricks. For aspect (2), the well-designed search space is
widely used in different ENAS methods. For instance, the
NASNet search space [144] is also used in [36], [132] because
it is well-constructed so that even random search can perform
well. The comparison under the same condition can tell the
effectiveness of different search methods.
Fortunately, the ﬁrst public benchmark dataset for NAS, the
NAS-Bench-101 [142] has been proposed. The dataset contains
432K unique convolutional architectures based on the cell-based
encoding space. Each architecture can query the corresponding
metrics, including test accuracy, training time, etc., directly in
the dataset without the large-scale computation. NAS-Bench-
201 [143] was proposed recently and is based on another
cell-based encoding space, which does not have no limits on
edges. Compared with NAS-Bench-101, which was only tested
on CIFAR-10, this dataset collects the test accuracy on three
different image classiﬁcation datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-16-120 [222]). But the encoding space is relatively
small, and only contains 15.6K architectures. Experiments with
different ENAS methods on these benchmark datasets can get
a fair comparison and it will not take too much time. However,
these datasets are only based on the cell-based encoding spaces
and cannot contain all the search space of the existing methods,
because the other basic units (layers and blocks) are built using
more hyper-parameters, which may lead to a larger encoding
space.
In the future, a common platform making fair comparisons
needs to be built. This platform must have several benchmarks
encoding space, such as the NASNet search space, NAS-Bench-
101 and NAS-Bench-201. All the ENAS methods can be
directly tested on the platform. Furthermore, this platform
also needs to solve the problem that different kinds of GPUs
have different computing power, which may cause an inaccurate
GPU Days based on different standards. The GPU Days cannot
be compared directly until they have a common baseline of
computing power.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of ENAS. We
introduced ENAS from four aspects: population representation,
encoding space, population updating, and ﬁtness evaluation
following the uniﬁed ﬂow, which can be seen in Fig. 2. The
various applications and the performance of the state-of-the-art
methods on image classiﬁcation are also summarized in tables
to demonstrate the wide applicability and the promising ability.
Challenges and issues are also discussed to identify future
research direction in this ﬁeld.
To be speciﬁc, ﬁrstly, the encoding space is introduced by
categories. We divide the encoding space into two parts: initial
space and search space, where the former one deﬁnes the initial
conditions whereas the latter one deﬁnes the architectures that
can be found in the evolutionary process. Also, different en-
coding strategies and architecture representations are discussed.
Secondly, the process of population updating including the
evolutionary operators, the multi-objective search strategy, and
the selection strategy are presented. A variety of EC paradigms
use respective metaphors to generate new individuals. Based
on standard algorithms, many improved methods have been
proposed to obtain a stable and reliable search capability.
Furthermore, we introduce the existing methods to reduce
the need for large amounts of time and computing resources,
which is a huge obstacle to efﬁciency.
Although the state-of-the-art methods have achieved some
success, ENAS still faces challenges and issues. The ﬁrst
important issue is whether the EC-based search strategy has
advantages. If the result is at the same level as the baseline
(e.g., random search), it is unnecessary to design the complex
evolutionary operators. A sophisticated experiment is in urgent
need to tell the effectiveness, especially in a large encoding
space. Secondly, the crossover operator is a multi-individual
based operator and there is no sufﬁcient explanation to how
the crossover operator works well on ENAS. Besides, ENAS is
just beginning a new era, so there is a lot of uncharted territory
to be explored. Moreover, a uniﬁed standard or platform is
demanded to make a fair comparison.
