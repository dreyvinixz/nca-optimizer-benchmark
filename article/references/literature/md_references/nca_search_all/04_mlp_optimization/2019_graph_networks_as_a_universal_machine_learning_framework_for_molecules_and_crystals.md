Abstract
Graph networks are a new machine learning (ML) paradigm that supports both
relational reasoning and combinatorial generalization. Here, we develop universal Ma-
tErials Graph Network (MEGNet) models for accurate property prediction in both
molecules and crystals. We demonstrate that the MEGNet models outperform prior
ML models such as the SchNet in 11 out of 13 properties of the QM9 molecule data
set.
Similarly, we show that MEGNet models trained on ∼60, 000 crystals in the
Materials Project substantially outperform prior ML models in the prediction of the
formation energies, band gaps and elastic moduli of crystals, achieving better than
DFT accuracy over a much larger data set. We present two new strategies to address
data limitations common in materials science and chemistry. First, we demonstrate
a physically-intuitive approach to unify four separate molecular MEGNet models for
the internal energy at 0 K and room temperature, enthalpy and Gibbs free energy into
a single free energy MEGNet model by incorporating the temperature, pressure and
entropy as global state inputs. Second, we show that the learned element embeddings
in MEGNet models encode periodic chemical trends and can be transfer-learned from

a property model trained on a larger data set (formation energies) to improve property
models with smaller amounts of data (band gaps and elastic moduli).
Introduction
Machine learning (ML)1,2 has emerged as a powerful new tool in materials science,3–14 driven
in part by the advent of large materials data sets from high-throughput electronic structure
calculations15–18 and/or combinatorial experiments.19,20 Among its many applications, the
development of fast, surrogate ML models for property prediction has arguably received the
most interest for its potential in accelerating materials design21,22 as well as accessing larger
length/time scales at near-quantum accuracy.11,23–28
The key input to any ML model is a description of the material, which must satisfy the
necessary rotational, translational and permutational invariances as well as uniqueness. For
molecules, graph-based representations29 are a natural choice. This graph representation
concept was then successfully applied to predict molecular properties.30,31 Recently, Faber
et al. 32 have benchmarked diﬀerent features in combination with models extensively on
the QM9 data set.33 They showed that the graph-based deep learning models34,35 generally
outperform classical ML models with various features. Furthermore, graph-based models
are generally less sensitive to the choice of atomic descriptors, unlike traditional feature
engineering-based ML models. For example, Sch¨utt et al.10,36 achieved state-of-the-art per-
formance on molecules using only the atomic number and atom coordinates in a graph-based
neural network model. Gilmer et al. 37 later proposed the message passing neural network
(MPNN) framework that includes the existing graph models with diﬀerences only in their
update functions.
Unlike molecules, descriptions of crystals must account for lattice periodicity and addi-
tional space group symmetries. In the crystal graph convolutional neural networks (CGCNN)
proposed by Xie and Grossman 9, each crystal is represented by a crystal graph, and invari-

ance with respect to permutation of atomic indices and unit cell choice are achieved through
convolution and pooling layers. They demonstrated excellent prediction performance on a
broad array of properties, including formation energy, band gap, Fermi energy and elastic
properties.
Despite these successes, current ML models still suﬀer from several limitations. First, it
is evident that most ML models have been developed on either molecular or crystal datasets.
A few notable exceptions are the recently reported SchNet36 and an update of the MPNN38
which have been tested on both molecules and crystals, although in both cases performance
evaluation on crystals is limited to formation energies only. Second, current models lack
a description of global state (e.g., temperature), which are necessary for predicting state-
dependent properties such as the free energy. Last but not least, data availability remain
a critical bottleneck for training high-performing models for some properties. For example,
while there are ∼69, 000 computed formation energies in the Materials Project,15 there are
only ∼6, 000 computed elastic constants.
In this work, we aim to address all these limitations.
We propose graph networks39
with global state attributes as a general, composable framework for quantitative structure-
state-property relationship prediction in materials, i.e., both molecules and crystals. Graph
networks can be shown to be a generalization/superset of previous graph-based models such
as the CGCNN and MPNN; however, because graph networks are not constrained to be
neural network-based, they are diﬀerent from the afore-mentioned models. We will demon-
strate that our MatErials Graph Network (MEGNet) models outperform prior ML models
in the prediction of multiple properties on the ∼131, 000 molecules in the QM9 data set33
and ∼69,000 crystals in the Materials Project.15 We also present a new physically-intuitive
strategy to unify multiple free energy MEGNet models into a single MEGNet model by
incorporating state variables such as temperature, pressure and entropy as global state in-
puts, which provides for multi-fold increase in the training data size with minimal increase
in number of model parameters. Finally, we demonstrate how interpretable chemical trends

can be extracted from elemental embeddings trained on a large data set, and these elemen-
tal embeddings can be used in transfer learning to improve the performance of models with
smaller data quantities.
Methods
MEGNet Formalism
Graph networks were recently proposed by Battaglia et al. 39 as a general, modular framework
for ML that supports both relational reasoning and combinatorial generalization. Indeed,
graph networks can be viewed as a superset of the previous graph-based neural networks,
though the use of neural networks as function approximators is not a prerequisite. Here, we
will outline the implementation of MEGNet models for molecules and crystals, with appro-
priate modiﬁcations for the two diﬀerent material classes explicitly described. Throughout
this work, the term “materials” will be used generically to encompass molecules to crystals,
while the more precise terms “molecules” and “crystals” will be used to refer to collections
of atoms without and with lattice periodicity, respectively.
Let V , E and u denote the atomic (node/vertex), bond (edge) and global state attributes
respectively. For molecules, bond information (e.g., bond existence, bond order, etc.) is
typically provided as part of the input deﬁnition. For crystals, a bond is loosely deﬁned
between atoms with distance less than certain cut-oﬀ. Following the notation of Battaglia
et al. 39, V is a set of vi, which is an atomic attribute vector for atom i in a system of N v
atoms. E = {(ek, rk, sk)}k=1:Ne are the bonds, where ek is the bond attribute vector for bond
k, rk and sk are the atom indices forming bond k, and N e is the total number of bonds.
Finally, u is a global state vector storing the molecule/crystal-level or state attributes (e.g.,
the temperature of the system).
A graph network module (Figure 1) contains a series of update operations that map an
input graph G = (E, V, u) to an output graph G′ = (E′, V ′, u′). First, the attributes of each

from atoms that form the bond, the state attributes and the previous bond attribute to the
new bond attributes. Similarly, the second and third steps update the atomic and global
state attributes, respectively, by information ﬂow among all three attributes. The ﬁnal result
is a new graph representation.

where N e
i is the number of bonds connected to atom i, and φv is the atom update function.
The aggregation step (Equation 2) acts as a local pooling operation that takes the average
of bonds that connect to the atom i.
The ﬁrst two update steps contain localized convolution operations that rely on the atom-
bond connectivity. One can imagine that if more graph network modules are stacked, atoms
and bonds will be able to “see” longer distances, and hence, longer range interactions can
be incorporated even if the initial distance cut-oﬀis small to reduce the computational task.

where φu is the global state update function. In addition to providing a portal to input
state attributes (e.g., temperature), u also acts as the global information placeholder for
information exchange on larger scales.
The choice of the update functions φe, φv and φu largely determines the model perfor-
mance in real tasks. In this work, we choose the φs to be multi-layer perceptrons with two
hidden layers (Equation 7), given their ability to be universal approximators for non-linear
functions.40
φ(x) = W3(ζ(W2(ζ(W1x + b1)) + b2)) + b3

where ζ is the modiﬁed softplus function10 acting as nonlinear activator, Ws are the kernel
weights and bs are the biases. Note that the weights for atom, bond and state updates
are diﬀerent. Each fully-connected layer will be referred as a “dense” layer using keras41
terminology.
To increase model ﬂexibility, two dense layers are added before each MEGNet module to
pre-process the input. This approach has been found to increase model accuracy. We deﬁne
the combination of the two dense layers with a MEGNet module as a MEGNet block, as
shown in Figure 2. The block also contains residual net-like42 skip connections to enable
deeper model training and reduce over-ﬁtting.
Multiple MEGNet blocks can stacked to
make more expressive models. In the ﬁnal step, a readout operation reduces the output
graph to a scalar or vector. In this work, the order-invariant set2set model43 that embeds a
set of vectors into one vector is applied on both atomic and bond attributes sets. After the
readout, the atomic, bond and state vectors are concatenated and passed through multi-layer
perceptrons to generate the ﬁnal output. The overall model architecture is shown in Figure
2. If the atom features are only the integer atomic numbers, an embedding layer is added
after the atom inputs V .

work by Faber et al. 32. For crystals, only the atomic number and spatial distance are used
as atomic and bond attributes, respectively.

Data Collections
The molecule data set used in this work is the QM9 data set33 processed by Faber et al. 32
It contains the B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p)-level DFT calculation results on 130,462 small organic
molecules containing up to 9 heavy atoms.
The crystal data set comprises the DFT-computed energies and band gaps of 69,640 crys-
tals from the Materials Project15 obtained via the Python Materials Genomics (pymatgen)44
interface to the Materials Application Programming Interface (API)45 on June 1, 2018. We
will designate this as the MP-crystals-2018.6.1 data set to facilitate future benchmarking
and comparisons as data in the Materials Project is constantly being updated. The crystal
graphs were constructed using a radius cut-oﬀof 4 ˚A. Using this cut-oﬀ, 69,239 crystals do
not form isolated atoms and are used in the models. All crystals were used for the formation
energy model and the metal against non-metals classiﬁer, while a subset of 45,901 crystals
with ﬁnite band gap was used for the band gap regression. A subset of 5830 structures have
elasticity data that do not have calculation warnings and will be used for elasticity models.
Model Construction and Training
A customized Python version of MEGNet was developed using the keras API41 with the
tensorﬂow backend.46 Since molecules and crystals do not have the same number of atoms,
we assemble batches of molecules/crystals into a single graph with multiple targets to enable
batch training. The Adam optimizer47 was used with an initial learning rate of 0.001, which
is reduced to 0.0001 during later epochs for tighter convergence.
Each data set is divided into three parts - training, validation and test. For the molecule
models, 90% of the data set was used for training and the remaining were divided equally
between validation and test. For the crystal formation energy models, 60,000 crystals were
used for training and the remaining were divided equally between validation and test for
direct comparison to the work of Sch¨utt et al. 36. For the band gap classiﬁcation models
and elastic moduli models, an 80:10:10 split was applied. All models were trained on the
10

training set, and the conﬁguration and hyperparameters with the lowest validation error
were selected. Finally, the test error is calculated. During training, the validation error is
monitored and the training is stopped when the validation error does not improve for 500
consecutive epochs. The models were trained on Nvidia GTX 1080Ti GPUs. On average,
it takes 80 and 110 seconds per epoch for each molecular and crystal model, respectively.
Most models reach convergence within 1000 epochs. However, models for U0, U, H, G,
and ⟨R2⟩require 2000 to 4000 epochs. In crystals, the embedding dimension is set to 16.
The elemental embeddings trained on the formation energy using one MEGNet block was
transferred to the band gap regression model and kept ﬁxed. We use the same architecture
featuring three MEGNet blocks in the models for crystals.
Data and Model Availability
To ensure reproducibility of the results, the MP-crystals-2018.6.1 data set used in this work
have been made available as a JavaScript Object Notation ﬁle at https://figshare.com/
articles/Graphs_of_materials_project/7451351. The graph network modules and over-
all models have also been released as open-source code in a Github repository at https:

Performance on QM9 Molecules
Table 2 compares the mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 13 properties for the diﬀerent models
and the convergence plots with number of training data are in Figure S1. It can be seen that
the MEGNet models using the full set of attributes (“Full” column in Table 2) outperforms
the state-of-art SchNet36 and MPNN enn-s2s models37 in all but two of the properties - the
norm of dipole moment µ and the electronic spatial extent R2. Out of the 13 properties,
only the errors on zero-point energy (ZPVE) (1.40 meV) and band gap (∆ϵ) (0.060 eV)

exceed the thresholds for chemical accuracy. The errors of various properties follow Gaussian
distributions, as shown in Figure S2.
We note that the atomic and bond attributes in Table 1 encode redundant information.
For example, the bond type can usually be inferred from the bonding atoms and the spatial
distance. We therefore developed “simple” MEGNet models that utilize only the atomic
number and spatial distance as the atomic and bond attributes, respectively. These are the
same attributes used in the crystal MEGNet models. From Table 2, we may observe that
these simple MEGNet models achieve largely similar performance as the full models, with
only slightly higher MAEs that are within chemical accuracy and still outperforming prior
state-of-the-art models in 8 of the 13 target properties. It should be noted, however, that the
convergence of the “simple” models are slower than the “full” models for certain properties
(e.g., µ, ZV PE). This may be due to the models having to learn more complex relationships
between the inputs and the target properties.
Uniﬁed Molecule Free Energy Model
To achieve the results presented in Table 2, one MEGNet model was developed for each
target, similar to previous works.36,37 However, this approach is extremely ineﬃcient when
multiple targets are related by a physical relationship and should share similar features. For
instance, the internal energy at 0K (U0) and room temperature (U), enthalpy (H = U +PV )
and Gibbs free energy (G = U + PV −TS) are all energy quantities that are related to each
other by temperature (T), pressure (P), volume (V ) and entropy (S). To illustrate this
concept, we have developed a combined free energy model for U0, U, H and G for the
QM9 data set by incorporating the temperature, pressure (binary) and entropy (binary) as
additional global state attributes in u, i.e., (0, 0, 0), (298, 0, 0), (298, 1, 0) and (298, 1, 1)
for U0, U, H and G, respectively. Using the same architecture, this combined free energy
model achieves an overall MAE of 0.010 eV for the four targets, which is comparable to the
results obtained using the separate MEGNet models for each target.

In principle, the combined free energy model should be able to predict free energies at
any temperature given suﬃcient training data. Indeed, the predicted U at 100 K and 200 K
match well with our DFT calculations (see Figure S3), even though these data points were not
included in the training data. However, the predicted H and G at the same temperatures
show large deviations from the DFT results. We hypothesize that this is due to the fact
that only one temperature data for these quantities exist in the training data and that the
addition of H and G data at multiple temperatures into the training data would improve
the performance of the uniﬁed free energy MEGNet model.

Table 3 compares the performance of the MEGNet models against the SchNet36 and
CGCNN models.9 The convergence of formation energy model is shown in Figure S4. We
may observe that the MEGNet models outperform both the SchNet and CGCNN models
in the MAEs of the formation energies Ef, band gap Eg, bulk modulus KV RH and shear
modulus GV RH.
It should be noted that these results - especially the prediction of Eg
and the metal/non-metal classiﬁers - are achieved over much diverse datasets than previous
works, and the prediction error in Ef, Eg, KV RH and GV RH are well within the DFT errors
in these quantities.48–52 The MEGNet models, similar to the SchNet models, utilize only

one atomic attribute (atomic number) and one bond attribute (spatial distance), while nine
attributes were used in the CGCNN model. We also found that transferring the elemental
embeddings from the Ef model, which was trained on the largest data set, signiﬁcantly
accelerates the training and improves the performance of the Eg, KV RH and GV RH models.
For example, an independently-trained model (without transfer learning) for Eg has a higher
MAE of 0.38 eV.
We note that the data set used in the development of the CGCNN model is signiﬁcantly
smaller than that of MEGNet or SchNet, despite all three models having obtained their data
from the Materials Project. The reason is that crystals with warning tags or without band
structures were excluded from the CGCNN model training. Using this exclusion strategy
and a similar training data size, the MEGNet models for formation energy and band gap
have MAEs of 0.032 eV atom−1 and 0.35 eV, respectively. The accuracies for metal and
non-metal classiﬁers are increased to 82.7% and 93.1% respectively.
There are also non-graph-based crystal ML models such as the JARVIS-ML model53 and
the AFLOW-ML model.54 The MAEs of the JARVIS-ML models53 for formation energy,
band gap, bulk moduli and shear moduli are 0.12 eV atom−1, 0.32 eV, 10.5 GPa and 9.5
15

GPa, respectively, while the MAEs of AFLOW-ML models54 for band gap, bulk moduli and
shear moduli are 0.35 eV, 8.68 GPa and 10.62 GPa, respectively. However, these ML models
are developed with very diﬀerent data sets (for example, the JARVIS-DFT database contains
formation energies, elastic constants and band gaps for bulk and 2D materials computed us-
ing diﬀerent functionals), and are therefore not directly comparable to the MEGNet, SchNet
or CGCNN models, which are all trained using Materials Project data.
Figures 3a and b provide a detailed analysis of the MEGNet model performance on
Ef. The parity plot (Figure 3a) shows that the training and test data are similarly well-
distributed, and consistent model performance is achieved across the entire range of Ef. We
have performed a sensitivity analysis of our MEGNet Ef model to various hyperparameters.
Increasing the radius cut-oﬀto 6 ˚A slightly increases the MAE to 0.03 eV atom−1. Using
one or ﬁve MEGNet blocks instead of three result in MAEs of 0.033 and 0.027 eV atom−1,
respectively.
Hence, we can conclude that our chosen radius cut-oﬀof 4 ˚A and model
architecture comprising three MEGNet blocks are reasonably well-optimized. Figure 3b plots
the average test MAEs for each element against the number of training structure containing
that element. In general, the greater the number of training structures, the lower the MAE
for structures containing that element. Figure 3c shows the receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve for the metal/non-metal classiﬁer. The overall test accuracy is 86.9%, and the
area under curve for the receiver operation conditions is 0.926.
Discussion
It is our belief that the separation of materials into molecules and crystals is largely arbi-
trary, and a true test of any structured representation is its ability to achieve equally good
performance in property prediction in both domains. We have demonstrated that graph
networks, which provide a natural framework for representing the attributes of atoms and
the bonds between them, are universal building blocks for highly accurate prediction mod-

els. Our MEGNet models, built on graph network concepts, show signiﬁcantly improved
accuracies over prior models in most properties for both molecules and crystals.
A key advance in this work is the demonstration of the incorporation of global state vari-
ables to build uniﬁed models for related properties. A proof of concept is shown in our uniﬁed
molecule free energy MEGNet model, which can successfully predict the internal energy at
multiple temperatures, enthalpy and Gibbs free energy with temperature, entropy and pres-
sure as global state variables. This stands in sharp contrast to the prevailing approach in
the materials ML community of building single-purpose models for each quantity, even if
they are related to each other by well-known thermodynamic relationships. The uniﬁcation
of related models has signiﬁcant advantages in that one can achieve multi-fold increases in
training data with minimal increase in model complexity, which is particularly important
given the relatively small datasets available in materials science.
Interpretability
For chemistry and materials science applications, a particularly desirable feature for any
representation is interpretability and reproduction of known chemistry intuition.55 To this
end, we have extracted the elemental embeddings from the MEGNet model for crystal for-
mation energy. As shown in Figure 4, the correlations between the elemental embeddings
correctly recover the trends in the periodic table of the elements. For example, the alkaline,
alkali, chalcogen, halogen, lanthanoid, transition metals, post transition metals, metalloid
and actinoid show highest similarities within their groups. It is important to note that the
extracted trends reproduce well-known “exceptions” in the periodic arrangement of atoms
as well. For example, the fact that Eu and Yb do not follow the lanthanoids but are closer
to alkaline earth elements (Figure S6) is in good agreement with chemical intuition and
matches well with the structure graphs proposed by Pettifor.56 Furthermore, these trends
are obtained from the diverse Materials Project dataset encompassing most known crystal
prototypes and 89 elements, rather than being limited to speciﬁc crystal systems57,58.

Such embeddings obtained from formation energy models are particularly useful for the
development of models to predict stable new compounds. Hautier et al. 59 previously de-
veloped an ionic substitution prediction algorithm using data mining, which has been used
successfully in the discovery of several new materials.60,61 The ion similarity metric therein
is purely based on the presence of ions in a given structural prototype, a somewhat coarse-
grained description. Here, the MEGNet models implicitly incorporate the local environment
of the site and should in principle better describe the elemental properties and bonding rela-
tionships. We note that with more MEGNet blocks, the contrast of the embeddings between
atoms are weaker, as shown in Figure S5. The two-dimensional t-SNE plots62 conﬁrm these
conclusions, as shown in Figure S6. This is because with more blocks, the environment seen
by the atom spans a larger spatial region, and the impact of geometry becomes stronger,
which obscures the chemical embeddings.
Composability
A further advantage of the graph network based approach is its modular and composable
nature. In our MEGNet architecture, a single block captures the interactions between each
atom and its immediate local environment (deﬁned via speciﬁed bonds in the molecule models
and a radius cutoﬀin the crystal models). Stacking multiple blocks allows for information
ﬂow, and hence, capturing of interactions, across larger spatial distances.
We can see this eﬀect in the MEGNet models for the QM9 data set, where diﬀerent
number of blocks are required to obtain good accuracy for diﬀerent properties. For most
properties, two blocks are suﬃcient to achieve MAEs within chemical accuracy. However,
more blocks are necessary for the zero-point vibrational energy (ﬁve), electronic spatial
extent (ﬁve) and dipole moment (three), which suggests that it is important to capture
longer-ranged interactions for these properties. In essence, the choice of number of MEGNet
blocks for a particular property model boils down to a consideration of the range of inter-
actions necessary for accurate prediction, or simply increasingly the number of blocks until
19

convergence in accuracy is observed.
Data Limitations and Transfer Learning
The critical bottleneck in building graph networks models, like all other ML models, is data
availability. For instance, we believe the inability of the uniﬁed free energy MEGNet model
to accurately predict H and G at 100 K and 200 K is largely due to the lack of training
data at those temperatures. Similarly, a general inverse relationship can be seen between
the number of training structures and the average MAE in formation energies of the crystals
in Figure 3b.
Besides adding more data (which is constrained by computational cost as well as chem-
istry considerations), another avenue for improvement is to use ensemble models. We tested
this hypothesis by training two independent three-block MEGNet models and used the aver-
age as the ensemble prediction for the formation energies of the Materials Project data set.
The MAE reduces from 0.028 eV atom−1 for single MEGNet model to 0.024 eV atom−1 for
the ensemble MEGNet model.
Yet another approach to address data limitations is transfer learning63,64, and we have
demonstrated an instructive example of how this can be applied in the case of the crys-
tal MEGNet models. Data quantity and quality is a practical problem for many materials
properties. Using the Materials Project as an example, the formation energy data set com-
prises ∼69, 000 crystals, i.e., almost all computed crystals in the database. However, only
about half of these have non-zero band gaps. Less than 10% crystals in Materials Project
have computed elastic constants, due to the high computational eﬀort in obtaining these
properties. By transferring the elemental embeddings, which encode the learned chemical
trends from the much larger formation energy data set, we were able to eﬃciently train the
band gap and elastic moduli MEGNet models and achieve signiﬁcantly better performance
than prior ML models. We believe this to be a particularly eﬀective approach that can be
extended to other materials properties with limited data availability.

Conclusion
To conclude, we have developed materials graph network models that are universally high
performing across a broad variety of target properties for both molecules and crystals.
Graphs are a natural choice of representation for atoms and the bonds between them, and
the sequential update scheme of graph networks provide a natural approach for information
ﬂow among atoms, bonds and global state. Furthermore, we demonstrate two advances -
incorporation of global state inputs and transfer learning of elemental embeddings - in this
work that extend these models further to state-dependent and data-limited properties. These
generalizations address several crucial limitations in the application of ML in chemistry and
materials science, and provide a robust foundation for the development of general property
models for accelerating materials discovery.
