1 Introduction
These days, in the area of soft computing research we can
observe a strong pressure to search for new optimization
techniques which are based on nature. Figure 1 presents
some approaches in optimization techniques with a con-
centration on evolutionary approaches. Today, the whole
family of evolutionary optimization algorithms is referred
to as evolutionary computation (EC) algorithms. In the
evolutionary computation domain, we can mention the
following main algorithms: the genetic algorithm (GA) [1],
genetic programming (GP) [2], differential evolution (DE)
[3], the evolution strategy (ES) [4], and evolutionary pro-
gramming (EP) [5]. Each of these techniques has many
different varieties and is used in many different industrial
applications.
This paper is a state-of-the-art paper which topic is
connected mainly with evolutionary algorithms (EAs) such
as GA, GP, DE, ES, and EP. (In the other paper [6], we
have presented swarm intelligence algorithms (SIAs) such
as ant colony optimization (ACO), particle swarm opti-
mization (PSO), and others in which social collaboration
between agents exist.) The other nature-based methods,
like family of physical algorithms (e.g., simulated anneal-
ing,
extremal
optimization,
harmony
search,
cultural
algorithm, gravitational search, river formation dynamics,
black hole algorithm), or family of plant intelligence
algorithms (e.g., ﬂower pollination algorithm, invasive
weed optimization, paddy ﬁeld algorithm, artiﬁcial plant
optimization algorithm, photosynthetic algorithm, plant
growth optimization, rooted tree optimization), are not
considered here due to their less popularity.
The aim of this paper is to present a short overview of
the practical applications of evolutionary algorithms (EAs).
The paper is the complement to [6] where a state of the art
of industrial (real-life) applications of swarm intelligence is
presented. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we
brieﬂy present the main EAs, namely genetic algorithm,
genetic programming, differential evolution, evolution
strategies,
and
evolutionary
programming.

selected areas. Finally, recent advances and the current
trends of the EAs are described.
2 Brief presentation of the EAs
2.1 Genetic algorithms
The genetic algorithm (GA) [1] is one of the oldest and
most known optimization techniques, which are based on
nature. In the GA, the search for solution space imitates the
natural process which takes place in the environment, and
the Darwinian theory of species evolution is taken into
consideration. In GAs, we have a population of individuals;
each, called a chromosome, represents a potential solution
to the problem. The problem being solved is deﬁned by the
objective function. Depending on how ‘‘good’’ the given
individual is ﬁtted to the objective function, the value
which represents its quality is attributed to it. This value is
referred to as the ﬁtness of the individual, and it is a main
evaluating factor. Highly valued individuals have a better
chance to be selected to the new generation of the popu-
lation. In GAs, we have three operators: selection (a new
population of individuals is created based on the ﬁtness
values of individuals from the previous generation),
crossover (typically parts of individuals are exchanged
between two individuals selected to the crossover), and
mutation (the values of particular genes are changed ran-
domly). Algorithm 1 presents the standard GA in the
pseudo-code form (for more details see [7]).
Many modiﬁcations of the standard GA have been
developed; some of them are listed in Table 1.
2.2 Genetic programming
Genetic programming (GP) [2] is relatively new; it is a spe-
cialized form of a GA which operates on very speciﬁc types of
solution, using modiﬁed genetic operators. The GP was
developed by Koza [2] as an attempt to ﬁnd the way for the
automatic generation of the program codes when the evalua-
tion criteria for their proper operation is known. Because the
searched solutionis a program, the evolved potential solutions
are coded in the form of trees instead of linear chromosomes
(of bits or numbers) widespread in GAs. As GP differs from
GA the used coding schema, the main loop of GP is the same
as in Algorithm 1. Of course, the genetic operators are spe-
cializedfor workingontrees,e.g.,crossover asexchangingthe
subtrees, mutation as a change of node or leaf. Some modiﬁ-
cations of the GP are shown in Table 1.
2.3 Differential evolution algorithm
The differential evolution (DE) is a type of evolutionary
algorithm useful mainly for the function optimization in
continuous search space. Although a version of DE algo-
rithm for combinatorial problems has also been discussed
[51], the principal version of the DE algorithm was

discussed by Storn and Price [3]. The main advantages of
DE over a traditional GA are: It is easy to use, and it has
efﬁcient memory utilization, lower computational com-
plexity (it scales better when handling large problems), and
a lower computational effort (faster convergence) [52]. The
standard DE procedure is shown in Algorithm 2. Presented
there DE optimizes the problem with n decision variables.
Parameter F scales the values added to the particular
decision variables (mutation), and CR parameter represents
the crossover rate [52] (xi;j is the value of jth decision
variable stored in ith individual in the population). More
detailed information on how the parameters should be
tuned can be found in [53]. The main idea of the DE
algorithm is connected with computing the difference
between two individuals chosen randomly from the popu-
lation. (The DE determines the function gradient within a
given area—not at a single point.) Therefore, the DE
algorithm prevents the solution of sticking at a local
extreme of the optimized function [52]. Twenty years of
DE development resulted in many modiﬁcations. Some of
them are shortly presented in Table 1.
2.4 Evolution strategies
The evolution strategies (ESs) are different when com-
pared to the GAs, mainly in the selection procedure. In the
GA, the next generation is created from the parental pop-
ulation by choosing individuals depending on their ﬁtness
value, keeping a constant size of the population. In the ES,
a temporary population is created; it has the different size
than the parental population (depending on the assumed
parameters k and l). In this step, the ﬁtness values are not
important. Individuals in the temporary population undergo
crossover and mutations. From such populations, an
assumed number of the best individuals are selected to the
next generation of the population (in a deterministic way).
ESs operate on the vectors of the ﬂoating point numbers,
while the classical GA operates on binary vectors. The
primary types of ESs are ES(1 þ 1), ES(l þ kÞ, and
ES(l; k) [7].
2.4.1 Evolution strategy ES(1 1 1)
It is the oldest approach; only one individual x is evolved.
The initial individual x is randomly generated. In each
iteration, only one new individual y is created. The cross-
over operator does not exist, and the mutation operator
creates the individual y by adding a randomly generated
number to each gene of the individual x. The normal dis-
tribution N with a mean value equal to zero and a standard
deviation equal to one is used. The value of ith gene in the
individual y is computed as follows: yi ¼ xi þ r  Nið0; 1Þ,
where r is a parameter which determines the range of the
mutation. Based on the ﬁtness value of individuals x and y,
the better one is selected for the new generation and
becomes a new individual x. Parameter r undergoes
adaptation by the so-called rule of 1/5 successes. Accord-
ing to this rule, the best results are obtained when the
relation R between successful mutations and all mutations
is equal to 1/5. When during k successive generations, the
relation R is higher than 1/5, then the value of the r
parameter is increased. When the relation R is lower than
1/5, then the value of the r parameter is decreased. The r
parameter does not change when the relation R is equal to
1/5 [7].

2.4.2 Evolution strategy ES(l + k)
This is an extension of the ES(1 ? 1). The ES(l þ k) has a
self-adaptive mutation range, which replaces the 1/5 suc-
cess rule implemented in ES(1 ? 1). In the ES(l þ k),
each individual in the population contains additional
chromosome r, consisting of values of standard deviation
for each gene. These values are used during mutation
procedure. The crossover operator operates before the
mutation. Both chromosomes (consisting of the value of
variables, and of the value of r parameters) undergo
mutation and crossover processes [7]. Algorithm 3 presents
the pseudo-code of the ES(l þ k).
2.4.3 ES(l,k) evolution strategy
This type of the ES is used more often than ES(l þ k). The
operation of both algorithms is almost identical. The only
one difference is that in the ES(l; k), the new population
P(t) is created using only the best individuals from the
‘‘children’’ population M(t). In this case, l has to be greater
than k. Such selection gives the advantage of ES(l; k) over
the ES(l þ k); in the latter, the population can be domi-
nated by one individual which is much better than others
and the values of standard deviations r are not well tuned.
The ES(l; k) does not have this disadvantage because the
individuals from the parental population Pðt  1Þ are not
copied to the new generation P(t) [7].
The pseudo-code of the ES(l; k) is almost the same as
Algorithm 3. The only one difference is line 10; here, it is:
‘‘10: select l the best individuals to population P(t) from
the population M(t).’’
Today, the covariance matrix adaptation evolution
strategy (CMA-ES) is perceived as a state-of-the-art ES
[54, 55]. Several variants of CMA-ES were developed [55]
to enhance the efﬁciency or robustness of the method by
different techniques. In the CMA-ES algorithm, the adap-
tation of the population size or other parameters was pre-
sented in papers [56]. The CMA-ES algorithm employs
global weighted recombination for both, strategy and
object variables, adapts the full covariance matrix for
mutation and, in general, is based on the scheme of the
ES(l; k). The CMA-ES algorithm can handle poorly scaled
functions, and its performance remains invariant under
rotation of the search space [54]. Some modiﬁcations of
ESs are mentioned in Table 2.
2.5 Evolutionary programming
Evolutionary programming (EP) was developed as a tool
for discovering the grammar of the unknown language.
However, EP became more popular when it was proposed
as the numerical optimization technique. The EP is similar
to the ES(l þ k), but with one essential difference [7]. In
EP, the new population of individuals is created by
mutating every individual from the parental population,
while in the ES(l þ k), every individual has the same
probability to be selected to the temporary population on
which the genetic operations are performed. In the EP, the
mutation is based on the random perturbation of the values
of the particular genes of the mutated individual. The
newly created and the parental populations are the same
sizes (l ¼ k). Finally, the new generation of the population
is created using the ranking selection of the individuals
from both, the parental and the mutated populations. The
pseudo-code of the standard EP method is presented in
Algorithm 4. EP, like other evolutionary methods, has
many modiﬁcations. Some of them are listed in Table 2.
2.6 Evolutionary algorithms: problems
and challenges
EAs are a very interesting research area. There are many
open research problems such as: control of the balance
between the exploration and exploitation properties; the

self-adaptive (or adaptive) control of steering parameters;
reducing the number of CMA-ES algorithm parameters;
introducing new selection schemes; and increasing their
effectiveness. The latter is important especially in the area
of evolutionary design and in evolvable hardware. Also,
new more efﬁcient techniques for constraint handling are
needed.
Additionally, more investigation into the application of
EAs to dynamic optimization problems, to the optimization
in noisy and non-stationary environments, and to multi-
objective optimization problems (especially with a large
number of decision variables) is required. Also, further
research is needed in the population size adaptation in
different optimization scenarios. Novel strategies should be
developed to deal with expensive problems more compet-
itively. Among these matters, there is the open question of
constraint handling in EAs speciﬁcally to solve engineering
optimization problems. As we know, the constraint han-
dling methods can be classiﬁed into six main categories:
penalty methods, methods evolving in the feasible region,
methods using parallel population approaches, methods
based on the assumption of superiority of feasible indi-
viduals, methods using multi-objective optimization tech-
niques, and hybrid methods. Of course, each of these
categories can be divided into several subcategories. The
taxonomy of the constraint handling techniques with EAs
can be found in the paper [77] by Petrowski et al. If we
want to use the proper constraint handling method in EAs
for real-world application, we should ﬁnd the answer to the
several questions such as is the objective function deﬁned
in the unfeasible domain (if not, the penalization methods
cannot be used, for example): are there any active

constraints at the optimum? (if not, the methods based on
the search on the feasible region boundaries are irrelevant);
what is the nature of the constraints? (if only one of the
constraints is a nonlinear inequality, the methods for linear
constraints are excluded). Moreover, in the real-world
application of EAs with constraint handling techniques the
effectiveness of a method is often dominated by two other
decision criteria such as complexity and difﬁculty of
implementation. Currently, penalty methods, feasibility
rules, and stochastic ranking methods are used in real-
world applications very often due to their simplicity [77].
Therefore, as we can see, there is no general approach for
handling the constraints with EAs able to deal with any
real-world problem, so the research on constraint handling
techniques in EAs for real-world application is still a hot
topic.
In EAs, there are many open research problems, which
are discussed in more detail in [53, 78].
Despite these weaknesses, we observe the growing
popularity of EAs (please see Figs. 2, 3). If we analyze the
number of publications in the Web of Science (WoS)
database (years 2000–2018) for particular EAs, we can see
that their number is growing from year to year for the
algorithms: GA, GP, DE, and ES. Only for EP algorithm,
the number of published articles has been decreasing since
the 2013 year. The total number of papers published in
WoS database (years 2000–2018) which are related to
these algorithms was equal to 98,596 for GA, 7038 for GP,
13,308 for DE, 1804 for ES, and 1585 for EP. Also, we
have study the popularity of some EA methods in the
selected scientiﬁc databases such as Google Scholar,
Springer, IEEE Xplore, ACM, Scientiﬁc, Science Direct,
Sage, Taylor, and Web of Science. The total number of the
papers was equal to 1,304,205 for GA, 186,791 for GP,
119,668 for DE, 53,254 for ES, and 73,716 for EP.
Also, many practical applications of EAs methods have
been patented by such corporations like Caterpillar Inc.,
Yamaha Motor Co. Ltd., Fujitsu Limited, International
Business Machines Corporation, Lsi Logic Corporation,
Honda Research Institute Europe Gmbh, Prometheus
Laboratories Inc., Siemens. The total number of patents
registered in the Google Patents database (in years
2000–2018) for the particular EA methods was equal to
43,284 for GA, 2960 for GP, 2039 for DE, 1191 for ES,
and 1583 for EP. More detailed information is presented in
Table 3.
We believe that over the next few years researchers will
focus on the above areas.

3 Evolutionary algorithms in real-life
problems
Similar to swarm intelligence algorithms [6], a major
reason is a growing demand for smart optimization meth-
ods in many business and engineering activities. EAs are
suitable mainly for optimization, scheduling, planning,
design, and management problems. These kinds of prob-
lems are everywhere, in investments, production, distri-
bution, and so forth. If we analyze, the results obtained
from the WoS database (popularity of only ten ﬁrst WoS
categories for each method—for more detailed information
see Table 4), we can see that the EAs methods are mainly
used in the area such as:
•
Engineering electrical electronics,
•
Computer science artiﬁcial intelligence,
•
Computer science theory methods,
•
Computer science interdisciplinary applications,
•
Automation control system,
•
Computer science information systems,
•
Operations research management science.
When in WoS we will select a ﬁeld Highly Cited in
Field, we can see that the highly cited papers (in which EA
methods are used) are from the following industry areas for
the particular EA methods:
•
GA—energy fuels (EF), engineering electrical elec-
tronic (EEE), operations research management science
(ORMS), engineering civil (EC),
•
GP—engineering civil (EC), water resources (WR),
energy fuels (EF), automation control systems (ACS),
•
DE—energy fuels (EF), automation control systems
(ACS), engineering electrical electronics (EEE), engi-

3.1 Genetic algorithms in real-life problems
The GAs are a universal optimization tool. Using GAs, we
can solve constrained optimization problems, multimodal
optimization problems, continuous optimization problems,
combinatorial optimization problems, and multi-objective
optimization problems. Thus, there is a wide range of real-
world applications of GAs. In this short section, we show
only a few of them.
The paper [79] (EF) by Lv et al. presents the solar array
layout optimization problem which is solved by GA. The
presented numerical method is based on rotating model of a
stratospheric airship to optimize the solar array layout. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method is helpful in
the preparation stage for installing large area ﬂexible solar
arrays. Also, it is shown that due to solar array optimization
the output power of solar panel is signiﬁcantly improved.
In paper [80] (EF) by Ma et al., the optimization model
based on the GA, developed to reduce the energy con-
sumption of high-sulfur natural gas puriﬁcation process, is
presented. A case study was performed in a high-sulfur
natural
gas
puriﬁcation
plant
with
the
capacity
of
300  104 N m3=d. The results demonstrate that the energy
consumption of the puriﬁcation plant was reduced by
12.7%.
In [81] (EEE), Yin et al. report a GA-inspired strategy
designed and incorporated in the sequential evolutionary
ﬁlter. Due to this strategy, the resampling used in most of
existing particle ﬁlters is not necessary, and the particle
diversity can be maintained. The experimental results show
that the proposed sequential evolutionary ﬁlter offers better
state estimation results than three other comparative ﬁlters.
The authors of [82] (EEE) investigate the pros and cons
of hybridization of a GA and local search on the basis of a
hard practical and up-to-date problem, namely the routing
and spectrum allocation of multi-cast ﬂows (RSA/M) in
elastic optical networks (EONs). They proposed an efﬁ-
cient optimization method for solving the RSA/M problem
in EONs. The proposed method outperformed all other
competing methods. Additionally, introduction of Baldwin
effects helped to preserve the population diversity in GA.
In the paper [83] (ORMS), the local-inventory-routing
model for perishable products is presented. The proposed
model integrates the three levels of a decision in the supply
chain such as the number and location of required ware-
houses, the inventory level at each retailer, and the routes
traveled by each vehicle. It is shown that the model
developed in this paper is NP-hard; therefore, the authors
develop a GA-based approach to solve this problem efﬁ-
ciently. It is shown that presented approach achieves a
high-quality near-optimal solution in reasonable time.
The paper [84] (ORMS) by Ramos et al. presents new
container loading algorithm with load balance, weight
limit, and stability constraints which use a load distribution
diagrams. This algorithm is based on multi-population
biased random-key GA, with a new ﬁtness function that
takes static and loads balance into account. Due to incor-
porate weight balance goal with stability guaranteed by full
base support and by the mechanical equilibrium conditions,
the proposed approach is very effective.

In [85] (EC) by Yan et al., a framework to determine the
investment plan to strengthen a railway system to earth-
quake hazard is proposed. This framework consists of four
parts. In the third part, an investment optimization model is
formulated, and in part four, this model is solved using GA.
The proposed approach has been applied to the real Chi-
nese railway system. The obtained results show that the
presented framework is more responsive to the earthquake
impact on railway system compared to topology-based
methods.
In the paper [86] (EC) by Ascione et al., the multi-
objective optimization of operating cost for space condi-
tioning and thermal comfort to achieve a high level of
building energy performance is presented. The main
objective of proposed GA is to optimize the hourly set
point temperatures with a day-ahead horizon, based on a
forecast of weather conditions and occupancy proﬁle. In
comparison with the standard control strategy, the pre-
sented approach generates a reduction of operating cost up
to 56%.
In [87] (EC) by Lin et al., a time-optimal train running
reference curve is designed with least time-consuming, but
highest energy consumption, and it is optimized by adding
multi-point coasting control to realize energy saving with a
relative rise in time. Multi-population GA is adopted to
solve this multi-point combinatorial optimization problem.
Simulation results, based on real line condition and train
parameters of Shanghai line 7, demonstrate the advance-
ment of multi-point coasting control with the proposed
approach.
In [88] (EC), the application of GA to minimization of
average delay for an urban signalized intersection under the
oversaturated condition is presented. Relieving urban
trafﬁc congestion is an urgent call for trafﬁc engineering.
One of the key solutions to reduce congestion is the
effectiveness of trafﬁc signalization. The current trafﬁc
signal control system is not fully optimized for handling
the oversaturated condition. Simulation results show that
GA is able to control the trafﬁc signals for minimizing the
average delay to 55 s/vehicle.
Zhang et al. [89] (EEE) use the ﬂexible GA for node
placement
problems.
Node
placement
problems
are
encountered
in
various
engineering
ﬁelds,
e.g.,
the
deployment of radio-frequency identiﬁcation systems or
wireless sensor networks. The ﬂexible GA with variable
length encoding, subarea-swap crossover, and Gaussian
mutation is able to adjust the number of nodes and their
corresponding
properties
automatically.
Experimental
results show that the ﬂexible GA offers higher performance
than existing tools for solving node placement problems.
In the paper [90] (EF) by Reddy, the scheduling problem
considering the hybrid generation system is presented. The
new strategy based on GA for the optimal scheduling
problem taking into account the impact of uncertainties in
the wind, solar photovoltaic modules with batteries, and
load demand forecast is proposed. From simulation results
(for IEEE 30 and 300 bus test systems), it can be noticed
that with a marginal increase in the cost of day-ahead
generation schedule, a signiﬁcant reduction in real-time
mean adjustment cost is obtained.
3.2 Genetic programming in real-life problems
The GP possesses many practical applications.
In [91] (ACS) et al. the handwriting character recogni-
tion system for inertial-sensor-equipped pens is presented.
In this system, the characteristic function is calculated for
each character using a GP algorithm. The experimental
results show that the performance of the proposed method
is superior to that one of the state-of-the-art works in the
area of recognizing Persian/Arabic handwriting characters.
Bagatur and Onen [92] (WR) propose novel models for
the prediction of ﬂood routing in natural channels using the
gene expression programming (GEP) algorithm, which is
one of the extensions of GP algorithm. The GEP method
makes use of few hydrologic parameters such as inﬂow,
outﬂow, and time. The performance of the proposed
models is evaluated by two goodness-of-ﬁt measures. The
proposed GEP models are tested for the three datasets
taken from the literature. It is proved that the GEP models
show superior performance to the other solution techniques
based on the Muskingum model.
In the paper [93] (EF) by Abkenar et al., an intelligent
fuel cell (FC) power management strategy is proposed. The
main objective of the proposed approach is to improve FC
performance
at
different
operating
points
without
employing DC/DC interfacing converters. A hybrid all-
electric ships (AES) driveline model using GP is utilized to
formulate operating FC voltage based on the load current,
FC air, and fuel ﬂow rates. The proposed approach main-
tains FC performance and reduces fuel consumption, and
therefore ensures the optimal power sharing between the
FC and the lithium-ion battery in AES application.
The authors of [94] (EC) use GP algorithm to develop
models to predict the deterioration of pavement distress of
the urban road network. Five models for the prediction of
pavement distress progression such as cracking, raveling,
pothole, rutting, and roughness are created. In order to
obtain a training dataset, and validation dataset, the real
data from the roads of Patiala City, Punjab, India, have
been collected. It was shown that GP models predict with
high accuracy for pavement distress and help the decision
makers for adequate and timely fund allocations for the
preservation of the urban road network.

3.3 Differential evolution in real-life problems
The
DE
algorithm
also
found
many
real-world
applications.
In [95] (EF), Ramli et al. present an application of multi-
objective SaDE algorithm for optimal sizing of a photo-
voltaic (PV)/wind/diesel hybrid microgrid system (HMS)
with battery storage. The multi-objective optimization is
used to analyze the loss of power supply probability, the
cost of electricity, and the renewable factor in relation to
HMS cost and reliability. The proposed approach is tested
using three case studies involving differing house numbers
for the city Yanbu, Saudi Arabia. The results obtained are
useful in investigating optimal scheduling of HMS com-
ponents and can be used as a power reference for the
economic operation of PV and wind turbine generators.
Yao et al. [96] (EF) use a multi-objective DE algorithm
for optimizing a novel combined cooling, heating, and
power-based compressed air energy storage system. The
system combines a gas engine, ammonia–water absorption
refrigeration system, and supplemental heat exchangers.
The proposed optimization technique is used to ﬁnd a
trade-off between the overall exergy efﬁciency and the
total speciﬁc cost of ﬁnal product. The best trade-off
solution which was selected possesses a total product unit
cost of 20.54 cent/kWh and an overall exergy efﬁciency of
53.04%.
In the paper [97] (ACS) by Wang et al., the DE algo-
rithm is applied for wind farm layout optimization with the
aim of maximizing the power output. Due to a new
encoding mechanism in DE, the dimension of the search
space is reduced to two, and a crucial parameter (i.e., the
population size) is eliminated. In comparison with seven
other methods, the proposed approach is able to obtain the
best overall performance, in terms of the power output and
execution time.
The authors of [98] (EEE) investigate the problem of
linear dipole array synthesis. Dynamic DE algorithm is
proposed for synthesizing shaped power pattern by using
element rotation and phase optimization for a linear dipole
array. Based on two experiments for synthesizing ﬂattop
and
cosecant
squared
pattern,
the
effectiveness
and
advantages of the proposed approach were veriﬁed in
comparison with the phase-only optimization and the
amplitude-phase joint optimization.
Tian et al. [99] (EC) use a multi-objective hybrid
DE?PSO algorithm in order to create a set of Pareto
solutions for the problem of dual-objective scheduling of
rescue vehicles to distinguish forest ﬁres. The novel multi-
objective scheduling model to handle forest ﬁres subject to
limited rescue vehicles constraints, in which a ﬁre spread
model is introduced into this problem to better describe
practical forestry ﬁre is presented. Results show that the
proposed approach is able to quickly produce satisfactory
Pareto
solutions
in
comparison
with
GA
and
PSO
algorithms.
3.4 Evolution strategies in real-life problems
Studying the literature, we can ﬁnd fewer papers with the
real-life applications of ESs than those with GAs. Below
we shortly present some of them.
The paper [100] (CBT) by Hasancebi presents ES inte-
grated parallel optimization algorithm to minimize the total
member weight in each test steel frame. Steel frames with
various beam–column connection and bracing conﬁgura-
tion are considered for comparative cost analyzes. Three
multi-story buildings are chosen (10, 20, and 30-story
buildings) as examples for numerical veriﬁcation of pro-
posed method. The results collected are utilized to reach
certain recommendations regarding the selection of eco-
nomically feasible frames for the design of multi-story
steel buildings.
In [101] (EF), Fadda et al. consider the usage of electric
batteries in order to mitigate it. In energy distribution
systems, uncertainty is the single major cause of power
outages; therefore, the authors propose intelligent battery
able to maximize its lifetime while guaranteeing to satisfy
all the electric demand peaks. The battery exploits a cus-
tomized steady-state ES to dynamically adapt its recharge
strategy to changing environments. Experimental results on
both synthetic and real data demonstrate the efﬁcacy of the
proposed approach.
In the paper [102] (EC) by Ogidan et al., the enhanced
non-dominated sorting ES algorithm that uses a specialized
operator to guide the algorithm toward known sanitary
sewer overﬂows (SSOs) locations is presented. The main
objectives of the proposed method are the maximization of
SSO reduction and minimization of rehabilitation cost. The
proposed method was tested in an existing network in the
eastern San Antonio Water System network. The presented
approach improves the convergence rate by approximately
70% over the tested alternative algorithms.
The authors of [103] (EEE) investigate the problem of
wireless sensor fault diagnosis based on fusion data anal-
ysis. The fault diagnosis model is proposed based on the
hierarchical belief rule-based model, and the CMA-ES
algorithm is used to optimize the initial parameters of the
proposed model. In order to validation of presented
approach, a case study based on Intel laboratory dataset of
sensors is designed. The experiments prove the effective-
ness of the proposed method in comparison with back
propagation neural network model and the fuzzy expert
system.

In the paper [104] (EEE), the problem of subsurface
inverse proﬁling of a 2-D inhomogeneous buried dielectric
target is presented and solved using proposed iterative
optimization method which is based on CMA-ES algo-
rithm. In relation to the results obtained using EP and PSO,
the results obtained using CMA-ES signiﬁcantly outper-
form the other two optimization techniques in the inho-
mogeneous imagining.
The paper [105] (EEE) by Emadi et al. presents CMA-
ES algorithm for tasks scheduling in the cloud computing
environment. The need for planning the scheduling of the
user’s jobs is an important challenge in the ﬁeld of cloud
computing. The causes are manifold; the most important
are: ever-increasing advancements of information tech-
nology, an increase in applications and user needs for these
applications with high quality, also the popularity of cloud
computing among user, and rapid growth of them during
recent years. The results obtained indicate that presented
algorithm, led to a reduction in execution time of all tasks,
compared to the shortest processing time algorithm, longest
processing time algorithm, and GA and PSO algorithms.
3.5 Evolutionary programming in real-life
problems
In the literature, we can ﬁnd the applications of EP in many
different areas. However, in WoS the number of papers in
which EP algorithm is used is decreasing since the 2013
year. Below we shortly present some of them.
The paper [106] (TST) by Yan et al. presents bi-sub-
group self-adaptive EP algorithm for seeking the Pareto
optimal solution of the multi-objective function of the
hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) and the best degree of hybrid
(DOH) for this vehicle. In the proposed algorithm, the
evolution of Cauchy operator and Gauss operator are par-
allel performed with different mutation strategies. More-
over, the Gauss operator owns the ability of self-adaptation
according to the variation of adaptability function. The
simulation results show that the optimal DOH is equal to
0.311 for given HEV. Also, the validity of simulating
method was proved, and the fuel saving effect was con-
sistent with authors’ expectations.
In the paper [107] (CBT) by Gao, a new evolutionary
neural network whose architecture and connection weights
simultaneously evolve is proposed. This neural network is
based on immunized EP algorithm and is used in the novel
inverse back analysis for underground engineering. As a
numerical example, an underground roadway of the
Huainan coal mine in China is chosen for the veriﬁcation of
the accuracy of the presented inverse back analysis. The
results obtained show that using the proposed method, the
computed displacements agree with the measured ones.
Therefore, it is demonstrated that the new inverse back
analysis method is a high-performance method for usage in
underground engineering.
Jiang et al. [108] (EC) use EP algorithm to ﬁnd weights
and the threshold value in the neural network which is
applied to the trafﬁc signal light control. According to the
historical trafﬁc ﬂow data of a crossroad, the next node’s
trafﬁc ﬂow data are predicted. Due to predicted data, the
trafﬁc signal light frequency can be re-adjusted in order to
improve trafﬁc congestion and other trafﬁc problems. The
results obtained show that the connection of EP algorithm
with the neural network has a good effect on trafﬁc signal
light optimization.
The authors of [109] (CSSE) propose a novel approach
to navigate over 3-D terrain using best viewpoints. The
concept of viewpoint entropy is exploited for best view
determination, and greedy n-best view selection is used for
visibility calculation. In order to connect the calculated
viewpoints, the authors use an EP algorithm for the trav-
eling salesman problem. It was shown that the computed
and planned viewpoints reduce human effort when used as
starting points for scene tour. The proposed method was
tested on real terrain and road network datasets.
3.6 Which EA should be used for a given
problem?
What lesson for a potential user of evolutionary computa-
tion emerges from the above overview? The question is
simple, but the answer is hard. All discussed methods are
from the same family—evolutionary approaches to opti-
mization problems. The principal question could be: Which
of the discussed methods is suitable for the given problem?
Expanding the answer to all heuristic methods in general,
not just evolutionary algorithms, the best answer seems to
be: take the method you know best, you can deﬁne your
problem well in terms required by this method, you
understand the sensitivity of this method to parameters, you
can ﬁne-tune this method. Let us see, for example, on
energy fuels area. Numerous evolutionary approaches are
applied within this scope. It is not possible to indicate one
of them as the best for this particular subject. The similar
situation is with other areas of industry.
As we can see, the literature on the evolutionary algo-
rithms in general and in their industrial applications is
plentiful, but very rarely this literature concerns applica-
tions that have been used in practice. Following [110], we
can say that the theory does not support the practice; there
is a big gap between theory and practice. Theoretical
results on properties such as convergence, diversity,
exploration, exploitation, deceptiveness, and epistasis are
not useful enough for practice. Signiﬁcant topics from the
practice point of view are constraint and noise handling
methods, robustness, or multi-objective optimization. The

progress in the above matters is also observed; however,
these methods are tested mainly on simple silo problems or
standard sets of numerical functions, so their usefulness to
practitioners working on EA-based software applications is
very limited.
It is worth mentioning that the real usefulness of EAs
could be not only in industry. The spectacular achievement
of EA is presented in [111]. The artiﬁcial intelligence
system, with the use of EA, the ﬁrst time discovered a new
theory, namely a mechanism of planar regeneration. The
remarkable ability of these small worms to regenerate body
parts made them a research model in human regenerative
medicine.
4 Summary and future trends
As it is shown in this paper, the evolutionary algorithms are
a popular research domain. Each year many new modiﬁ-
cations of these algorithms are proposed. Some of these
modiﬁcations are shortly described in Tables 1 and 2. The
EAs are applied to solve many industry problems. When
we cannot use a dedicated algorithm for a given problem,
one of the EAs will be a good choice. Of course, we must
remember about speciﬁc issues the user can face when
dealing with EAs. Here, we can mention two main prob-
lems. First of this problem is a premature convergence (the
population converging to a suboptimal solution instead of
an optimal one). We can solve this problem by introducing
the mechanism which will provide a lower transfer rate of
the genetic material between individuals—the whole pop-
ulation is divided into several subpopulations (so-called
islands) and periodically migrate an individual between
islands [15]. Another solution of the premature conver-
gence problem is a cooperation of EAs with branch and
bound algorithm endowed with interval propagation tech-
niques, as it was shown in [112]. The second problem is
related to the optimal trade-off between exploration and
exploitation properties of EA. One of the solutions to this
problem is control of the level of selection pressure [113].
We can do this by introducing specialized genetic operators
which will guarantee high population diversity at the start
of the algorithm operation (high exploration property–
small exploitation property) and a low population diversity
at the end of the algorithm operation (low exploration
property–high exploitation property). A survey about
exploration and exploitation in EAs can be found in [114].
As future trends in EAs, we can mention some main
directions. The ﬁrst of current trend is a hybridization of
two or more algorithms to obtain better results. Currently,
in the literature, we can ﬁnd an increasing number of
papers where hybrid algorithms are presented. Also, many
researchers work on modiﬁcations of EAs to improve their
computational performance. In many recently published
papers, we can ﬁnd modiﬁcations of GA [22, 23, 115, 116],
GP [31, 32, 117, 118], DE [48, 49, 119, 120], ES [64, 65],
and EP [74, 75]. An interesting domain of future research
in EAs is also memetic algorithms. The term memetic
algorithm is widely used as a synergy of the evolutionary
algorithm or any other population-based approach with
separate local search techniques as the Nelder–Mead
method. We can ﬁnd very interesting information about
future trends in EAs in the paper [121] written by Eiben
et al. As one of the future trends in EAs, the authors point
out the increasing interest in applying EAs to embodied or
embedded systems, that is, employing evolution in popu-
lations for which the candidate solutions are controllers or
drivers that implement the operational strategy for some
situated entities, and are evaluated within the context of
some rich, dynamic environment: not for what they are, but
for what they do. Finally, there is another one important
issue especially in the industrial application of EA meth-
ods. Very often in real-world problems, we must optimize a
function in a high-dimensional domain. This process usu-
ally is very complex and takes a lot of computational time.
Therefore, in real applications, the EAs designed for this
type of problems should be designed to be implemented
easily to run in parallel (or easy to run in GPU) to reduce
their computational time. A greater effort in this feature
should be in future proposals because this could be a cru-
cial feature to decide whether an algorithm is useful in real
applications. Some research in the area of EAs can be
connected with the so-called surrogate models (computa-
tionally cheaper models of real-world problems) which can
be used in the place of full ﬁtness evaluation, and that
reﬁne those models through occasional full evaluations of
individuals in the population [121]. Also, very often
industry problems have many objectives. In tandem with
algorithmic advances, the interactive evolutionary algo-
rithms are used to increase the efﬁciency of EAs in multi-
objective optimization [121]. As we know, each engi-
neering problem is deﬁned by the different objective
function and has a different landscape of search space. The
values of EAs parameters which are ‘‘good’’ in one prob-
lem cannot be sufﬁcient in another one. Therefore,
searching for new techniques in such area as automated
tuning and adaptive parameter control is still a hot topic in
EAs. Another important issue in the industrial application
of EA methods is a proper deﬁnition of an objective
function. The industrial problems are very complex.
Therefore, a deﬁnition of a good mathematical model
(good objective function for EAs) for a given industry
process is also a very demanding task. The ‘‘quality’’ of the
chosen objective function will have a great inﬂuence on the
results obtained using EA methods. The next issue which
we want to mention in discussing is repeatability of the EA

methods. As we know, the EAs are stochastic techniques.
Each time the EA method is run, a different result can be
obtained. Therefore, the main focus should be on ensuring
repeatability of the results generated by EA techniques.
This issue is very important for application on EA methods
in industry.
In summary, we believe that in the future, new evolu-
tionary algorithms will be developed, and the research
problems connected with evolutionary algorithms will
always be a hot topic for researchers.
