Abstract
Time series forecasting models are essential decision support tools in real-world domains. Stock market is a remarkably
complex domain, due to its quickly evolving temporal nature, as well as the multiple factors having an impact on stock
prices. To date, a number of machine learning-based approaches have been proposed in the literature to tackle stock trend
prediction. However, they typically tend to analyze a single data source or modality, or consider multiple modalities in
isolation and rely on simple combination strategies, with a potential reduction in their modeling power. In this paper, we
propose a multimodal deep fusion model to predict stock trends, leveraging daily stock prices, technical indicators, and
sentiment in daily news headlines published by media outlets. The proposed architecture leverages a BERT-based model
branch ﬁne-tuned on ﬁnancial news and a long short-term memory (LSTM) branch that captures relevant temporal patterns
in multivariate data, including stock prices and technical indicators. Our experiments on 12 different stock datasets with
prices and news headlines demonstrate that our proposed model is more effective than popular baseline approaches, both in
terms of accuracy and trading performance in a portfolio analysis simulation, highlighting the positive impact of multi-
modal deep learning for stock trend prediction.

Time series prediction
1 Introduction
From the start of the 20th century, the ﬁnancial sector has
made consistent investments in researching price predic-
tion and market dynamics models [1]. For the purpose of
forecasting stock price trends, conventional quantitative
approaches rely on historical time series price data [2]. In
recent days, leveraging models to analyze ﬁnancial time
series has become essential for managing market risks and
making informed investment decisions [3].
An escalating quantity of progressively advanced mod-
els is being introduced in research works to address the
inherent intricacies of time series data within speciﬁc
domains. Notably, stock market data is quite complex, as it
is characterized by a multi-dimensional, volatile, and
dynamically evolving nature. Furthermore, stock market
data displays interconnections with various external fac-
tors, such as macroeconomic events and news disseminated
by media sources. Consequently, appropriately integrating
these factors is of paramount importance when developing
predictive models that yield satisfactory levels of accuracy.
Autoregressive
models
[4–10]
are
proﬁcient
in
addressing prediction tasks that take into account temporal
auto-correlation, but fall short in adequately accounting for
the multivariate nature of the data and the intricacies of
nonlinear feature interactions. On the other hand, machine
learning and deep learning models tailored for temporal

data, exempliﬁed by long short-term memory models and
their various adaptations [11–21], are capable of mitigating
these limitations. However, their utility is typically con-
ﬁned to the analysis of a single data source, thereby
diminishing their effectiveness in highly volatile and
challenging-to-predict domains. Therefore, it is advisable
to explore ensemble-based and hybrid combination meth-
ods [22–32] as they hold greater promise compared to other
approaches. These methods can encompass multiple data
sources and harness the diversity of multiple predictors,
offering a more comprehensive solution to address the
challenges of data analysis in such complex and dynamic
domains.
A signiﬁcant drawback of many works in the literature is
that they are limited to the analysis of a single source of
data (or modality). Some studies highlighted that the
analysis of ﬁnancial news in addition to stock prices may
play a key role in stock market prediction [33, 34]. For this
reason, researchers are focusing on devising new and more
sophisticated ways to integrate different relevant sources of
data that may impact stock prices, resulting in more
accurate models.
However, several methods that consider multiple sour-
ces of data, address them in isolation, relying on simple
combination strategies to perform a joint analysis. More-
over, the specialized terminology and scarcity of labeled
data in the ﬁnancial industry exacerbates the difﬁculty of
accurately performing sentiment analysis, making general-
purpose text-based models insufﬁcient. To this aim, lan-
guage models ﬁne-tuned on ﬁnancial textual data present
provide new exciting opportunities for the integration of
accurate textual analysis in stock market prediction models
[35].
In this paper, we propose a multimodal deep learning
model for stock market trend prediction that consists of two
branches: a FinBERT branch which specializes on the
analysis of the textual content in ﬁnancial news and
accurately model market sentiment, and a LSTM branch
which captures temporal market dynamics in complex
multivariate data, including stock prices and technical
indicators. Our deep fusion approach allows us to effec-
tively leverage multiple modalities leading to improved
generalizability, reduced bias, and increased efﬁciency
compared to single-modality approaches.
In summary, the main contributions of our paper can be
summarized as follows:
•
We propose a deep fusion model architecture for stock
market trend prediction that seamlessly considers and
integrates multiple modalities (stock prices, technical
indicators, news headlines) in a joint feature space with
multiple specialized branches, empowering the model
with a more comprehensive understanding of patterns
and complex nonlinear relationships in stock market
dynamics that leads to the extraction of more robust and
trustworthy next-day trend predictions;
•
We devise an end-to-end optimization and hyperpa-
rameter tuning workﬂow which allows us to identify
and select highly effective conﬁgurations for each
branch of the fusion model, resulting in a competitive
stock prediction performance tailored to the character-
istics of a speciﬁc stock under analysis;
•
We perform an extensive evaluation of 12 real-world
stocks from different sectors in two different evaluation
periods and with different market conditions (uptrend,
downtrend). This evaluation encompasses two analyt-
ical perspectives: model accuracy and portfolio perfor-
mance
in
a
realistic
simulation,
where
model
predictions are leveraged for practical automated trad-
ing decisions. Our experimental results show that our
approach can outperform state-of-the-art methods for
stock market prediction.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 summarizes
relevant works for stock market prediction. Section 3
describes our proposed method in detail. Section 4 dis-
cusses our experimental settings and the results obtained in
our experiments. Section 5 wraps up the paper and dis-
cusses relevant directions for future work.

In this section, we review relevant works pertaining to time
series prediction and forecasting, with particular focus on
stock market analysis.
2.1 Autoregressive models
Autoregressive models are recognized for their ability to
characterize associations across multiple time steps for a
target feature through the learning of coefﬁcients. One
prominent autoregressive technique is the autoregressive
integrated moving average (ARIMA) model [4]. Renowned
for its efﬁcacy in short-term prediction tasks, ARIMA
forecasts the future value of a variable by linearly com-
bining past values and errors, following the application of
differentiation operations to render the time series sta-
tionary. The methodology outlined in [5], for instance,
employs an ARIMA model to predict coronavirus cases
using Johns Hopkins epidemiological data. Prophet [6]
stands out as another prevalent autoregressive forecasting
method, grounded in an additive model that accommodates
nonlinear trends through yearly, weekly, and daily varia-
tions. This approach also addresses seasonality and holiday
effects, demonstrating robustness to outliers and missing

data. Prophet aims at enhanced conﬁgurability and user-
friendliness in comparison with ARIMA. Vector autore-
gression (VAR) [7] is another noteworthy autoregressive
approach that extends beyond predictive tasks for single
variables. This method concurrently learns coefﬁcients for
multiple variables, considering their temporal correlations.
A noteworthy investigation in [8] highlights its effective-
ness in forecasting tasks embedded within a spatiotemporal
context. In the realm of stock market applications, recent
research [9] introduces a moving average heterogeneous
autoregressive (MAT-HAR) model, treating thresholds as a
moving average-generated, time-varying parameter. This
model is employed to forecast the monthly realized
volatility of the US stock market. Another study [10]
applies univariate ARIMA models to the Amman Stock
Exchange. Despite their effectiveness in numerous appli-
cations, autoregressive models exhibit certain limitations.
Besides being limited to the analysis of single variables or
modalities, their simplicity makes them incapable of cap-
turing nonlinear relationships between multiple variables,
which are frequently encountered in real-world multivari-
ate data.
2.2 Machine learning and deep learning models
Machine learning and deep learning models tailored for
temporal data, such as long short-term memory (LSTM)
[36] models and their variations, constitute an advancement
over autoregressive models due to their capacity to effec-
tively analyze multivariate data and handle nonlinear fea-
ture interactions. In the research by [12], recurrent neural
network (RNN) models featuring long short-term memory
units are proposed to predict pollutant particle levels at
multiple time horizons. In the domain of stock market
analysis, [13] employs an LSTM model to predict the next-
day closing price of the S &P 500 index, utilizing nine
predictors
selected
from
fundamental
market
data,
macroeconomic data, and technical indicators. The authors
in [14] introduce an LSTM-based model architecture for
forecasting air leaks, assessing its potential within the
healthcare sector. The work in [15] devises a tensor
decomposition approach for feature extraction, where
predictive clustering trees are used for forecasting, and
their performance is compared to LSTM models. A com-
parative investigation of deep neural networks with LSTM
networks for stock market analysis is presented by [16],
focusing on daily and weekly movements of the Indian
BSE Sensex index. Another work by [11] empirically
analyzed LSTM networks leveraging a diverse set of real-
world datasets, and identiﬁed that such models are quite
effective in predicting stock market prices. The study in
[17] conducts a comparative analysis involving LSTM,
gated recurrent unit (GRU), and drop-GRU models in the
context of power consumption forecasting, demonstrating
the satisfactory performance of the devised models in this
application. Combinations of GRU and convolutional
neural networks (CNN) have also been explored. For
instance, the GRU-CNN model proposed in [37] has shown
to be effective for stock market prediction. A decision
support system reinforced with LSTM for swing trading is
proposed in [18], where predictions and reports that
incorporate forecasted values of company stock for the
next 30 days are extracted, alongside technical indicators.
In the research by [19], bidirectional and stacked LSTM
predictive models are benchmarked against shallow neural
networks and simpliﬁed forms of LSTM networks, with
analyses conducted on publicly available stock market
data.
The work in [20] demonstrates that LSTM networks
combined with bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU)
can accurately predict the closing price of stock market,
offering a more competitive performance than simpler
models. In [21], a bidirectional LSTM model (Bi-LSTM),
proposed for the ﬁrst time for speech recognition tasks
[38], is adopted and optimized by particle swarm opti-
mization (PSO), giving place to a PSO-Bi-LSTM approach
to predict useful long-, mid-, and short-term investment
strategies. A CNN-LSTM model complemented by an
attention mechanism was proposed in [39]. Dilated con-
volutions have been explored in [40] and have shown great
success in extracting multi-scale patterns at different time
granularities. A common limitation of these approaches is
their conﬁnement to the analysis of a single data type or
modality, which constrains their effectiveness in the pres-
ence of highly volatile phenomena that depends on multi-
ple factors.
2.3 Ensemble-based and hybrid models
Ensemble-based and combination methodologies involving
hybrid models offer a robust approach to address these
intricacies, encompassing the utilization of multiple data
sources and the amalgamation of various predictors. An AI
platform, as proposed by [22], leverages four machine
learning
ensemble
methods,
namely
neural
network
regression ensemble, support vector regression ensemble,
boosted regression trees, and random forest. The best
ensemble method for a given stock is selected through a
cross-validation evaluation. In [23], a fusion network is
proposed to extract text and numerical information for
stock price prediction, with the addition of an attention
mechanism to improve the overall model performance.
A stacking ensemble approach for predicting stock
closing prices is proposed in [24], where a competitive
performance is obtained when contrasted with conven-
tional machine learning ensemble models such as random

forest, AdaBoost, and gradient boosting machines. A
stacking approach was also explored in [41] with joint
consideration of news headlines, multivariate time series
data, and multiple base models as predictors. Authors in the
work by [25] propose a hybrid forecasting model for stock
prices
that integrates
various deep
learning
models,
speciﬁcally,
CNN-LSTM
[42],
GRU-CNN
[37],
and
ensemble models. The work in [26] introduces a hybrid
model denoted as PCA-EMD-LSTM, which combines
principal component analysis, empirical mode decompo-
sition, and LSTM for predicting stock market trends in
Thailand. The hybrid model proposed in [27] utilizes
decomposition
techniques,
multi-factor
analysis,
and
attention-based LSTM to forecast stock market price trends
in four major Asian countries. In [28], a hybrid method for
analyzing stock markets is introduced, which combines an
autoencoder-based feature extraction network with a tem-
poral convolutional model architecture and a temporal
clustering optimization algorithm utilizing the KL (Kull-
back–Leibler) divergence. The approach in [43] employs a
CNN model to perform sentiment classiﬁcation and inte-
grates it to a LSTM analyzing technical indicators, showing
that the joint consideration of both aspects leads to
improved predictions. A deep learning approach is pro-
posed in [29], where future stock prices are predicted by a
blending ensemble learning model that combines two
recurrent neural networks followed by a fully connected
neural network. The authors in [30] conduct an analysis of
the collective sentiment’s signiﬁcance on popular S &P500
stocks and assess its efﬁcacy in investment decision-mak-
ing. A study in [31] presents a framework based on LSTM
and convolutional neural networks to predict the closing
prices of Tesla and Apple, utilizing historical data collected
over the past two years. Two stock trading decision
methods have been applied in [32]: nested reinforcement
learning (Nested RL) using three deep reinforcement
learning models, and a weighted random selection with
conﬁdence (WRSC) strategy. The results show that their
approach
outperforms
baselines,
enhancing
portfolio
management for higher proﬁts at the same risk level.
3 Method
In this section, we describe our method in detail, focusing
on its workﬂow. The proposed method involves a multi-
modal deep learning approach that combines information
from historical stock prices and statistical indicators with
news headlines. The model employs long short-term
memory (LSTM) networks and bidirectional encoder rep-
resentations from transformers (BERT) models to capture
both quantitative and qualitative information. For the text
component, we leverage FinBERT to conduct sentiment
analysis. A fusion layer combines the two modalities and
yields a ﬁnal stock price prediction. A graphical repre-
sentation of the method is shown in Fig. 1.
3.1 Data gathering, preprocessing, and fusion
Our method aims to comprehensively analyze stock prices,
statistical trading indicators, and news headlines. To
achieve this goal, we obtain data from two Application
Programming Interfaces (APIs). The initial API, referred to
as Yahooquery,1 is employed for retrieving historical stock
prices, serving as an unofﬁcial substitute for the obsolete
Yahoo Finance API. We input stock tickers in string for-
mat, and the API provides all historical data available for a
speciﬁed stock within a given date range. The data
obtained from the API comprises the opening price, high
and low values, adjusted closing prices, and the daily
observed volume. Subsequently, we employ the TA-lib
Python library2 to incorporate computed statistical indica-
tors into the extracted stock data. These statistical indica-
tors, widely used in technical analysis, encompass the
exponential moving average (12-day, 26-day), moving
average convergence/divergence (MACD), parabolic SAR,
Bollinger bands (upper band, middle band, and lower
band), and stochastic (Slow k, Slow d). Before model
training, all numerical data undergoes min-max normal-
ization. In our study, we do not perform feature selection to
identify a subset of suitable features for each stock.
Although some features may be more relevant than others
for a given stock under analysis, the adopted deep learning
architecture should, in principle, automatically learn fea-
ture inﬂuence via gradient descent optimization. Speciﬁ-
cally, weak features will be characterized by small weights
with a vanishing effect in the deeper layers of the network
and a tendency to be discarded for prediction. In contrast,
relevant features will lead to strong/high activation values
that inﬂuence the prediction signiﬁcantly.
As a secondary API, we utilize the end-of-day historical
ﬁnancial data (EODHD) API to fetch news headlines based
on a given stock ticker. For instance, a query with the
‘‘aapl’’ ticker as input yields data on news articles,
including posting time, titles, article content, URL links, as
well as tagged symbols and tickers. To maintain focus on
reliable news sources, we exclusively retain articles
sourced from Yahoo Finance, discarding those from other
origins.

3.2 Long short-term memory (LSTM)
Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks repre-
sent a category of recurrent neural networks (RNN)
extensively applied in the analysis of time series data,
owing to their ability of capturing prolonged dependencies
within sequential data [44]. The utility of LSTM models
lies in their capacity to discern and forecast patterns in time
series data, which makes them valuable for predictive
tasks. LSTMs address the challenge of vanishing and
exploding gradients encountered in traditional RNNs
[45, 46] by introducing memory cells to replace recurrent
nodes. A distinguishing feature of a memory cell is its
internal state, facilitating the ﬂow of gradients across
multiple time steps without vanishing or exploding [44].
Each memory cell comprises multiple nodes referred to
as gates. The data from the current time step is fed into
these LSTM gates, as well as into the hidden state from the
preceding time step. Subsequently, three fully connected
layers compute the values associated with the input, forget,
and output gates. A sigmoid activation function is applied
to these values to yield the ﬁnal output, constrained within
a (0, 1) range.
An input node undergoes computation through a tanh
activation function. In essence, the gates modulate the
signiﬁcance of the information passed to the model at
distinct time steps. The input gate gauges the proportion of
the input node’s value to be added to the current internal
state of the cell. The forget gate determines whether the
prevailing value of the cell should be retained or discarded.
Finally, the output gate decides if the memory cell should
contribute to the output of the ongoing time step.
Assuming the presence of d inputs, h hidden units, and a
batch size of n, the input is deﬁned as Xt 2 Rnd, and the
hidden state of the previous time step is deﬁned as
Ht1 2 Rnh. The gates at time step t are deﬁned as fol-
lows: the input gate is It 2 Rnh, the forget gate is
Ft 2 Rnh, and the output gate is Ot 2 Rnh. Formally,
they are calculated as:

The incorporation of LSTM cells equips the model with
the ability to address intricate temporal patterns in multi-
variate data, enabling the capture of nonlinear and enduring
relationships among various features and timestamps. This
capability is leveraged to allow the model to discern resi-
lient patterns within historical data, encompassing statisti-
cal indicators, and facilitate the extraction of relationships
between stock prices and other descriptive features.
3.3 FinBERT
BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from trans-
formers) is a complex deep neural network model for
natural language processing (NLP). BERT achieved state-
of-the-art results in various NLP tasks such as text classi-
ﬁcation, question answering, and named entity recognition.
BERT uses a transformer architecture that allows capturing
long-range dependencies and context in text data, making it
highly effective for tasks involving understanding and
processing human language. The high accuracy docu-
mented in several research works supports the adoption of
BERT as a versatile model for many different NLP tasks
[47]. Among them, BERT is often used to extract contex-
tual embedding vectors from text, which can be adopted for
subsequent downstream tasks. However, the performance
of the model is strictly related to the pertinence of the
dataset used to train the model. While using pre-trained
general-purpose language may be a practical solution to
avoid expensive training costs, it may result in a poor
representation of topic-speciﬁc textual content [48]. To
overcome this limitation, we leverage FinBERT [35], a
language model specialized for ﬁnancial data analysis,
which obtained the highest scores on FiQA sentiment

The model architecture consists of multiple stacked

r is the layer normalization, with l and

To prevent catastrophic forgetting, FinBERT applies
three state-of-the-art techniques: slanted triangular learning
rates, discriminative ﬁne-tuning, and gradual unfreezing.
FinBERT takes an initial BERT model trained on
BookCorpus and Wikipedia, an ﬁne-tunes it on the TRC2-
ﬁnancial corpus, a subset of Reuters’ TRC24, which con-
sists of 1.8M news articles published by Reuters between
2008 and 2010. Subsequently, FinBERT is ﬁne-tuned on
Financial Phrasebank corpus consists of 4845 English
sentences from ﬁnancial news found on LexisNexis data-
base, annotated by 16 people with background in ﬁnance
and business [50].
FinBERT extracts sentiment scores for all news head-
lines gathered for a speciﬁc stock on a given day. It returns
a positive, neutral, and negative score for each news. For
textual data, we remove stopwords, punctuation marks,
square brackets, and lowercase, in order to reduce noise
and focus on meaningful words. Initially, we obtain a
summary of the day consisting of two values: sum of
positive scores, and sum of negative scores. Subsequently,
the largest of the two scores determines if the day is overall
positive or negative. Based on this information, we select
the most representative news headline, i.e., the one with the
largest positive or negative score, and extract its embed-
ding vector representation.3
We note that sentiment scores extracted by FinBERT are
used exclusively for news selection. Separately, we ﬁne-
tune FinBERT with the ﬁnancial news in our dataset, and
we replace the output layer with a single-unit dense layer
(to predict uptrend/downtrend directly) and optimize it
considering different hyperparameter conﬁgurations (see
Table 2). The best-performing conﬁguration is identiﬁed
based on accuracy using a validation set.
Afterward, in the proposed model architecture, we
remove the classiﬁcation layer used during optimization
and exploit the embedding vector representation of the
news for subsequent fusion.
3.4 Multimodal fusion
Our novel multimodal fusion approach is tailored for next-
day stock market trend prediction. This branch of the
model is responsible for fusing the two data modalities:
time series and text. More in detail, the model incorporates
time series data processed through LSTM (long short-term
memory), a type of recurrent neural network renowned for
its effectiveness in handling sequential data, and text
embeddings processed through FinBERT, a specialized
model speciﬁcally tailored for the analysis of ﬁnancial text
data. The primary objective of this approach is to enhance
prediction accuracy and robustness by fusing information
from different data sources or modalities.
The structural layout of the model is visually depicted in
Fig. 1, illustrating how the two data modalities are seam-
lessly integrated. This model leverages multimodal learn-
ing,
which
empowers
the
model
with
a
more
comprehensive understanding of the underlying patterns
and relationships within the data. This, in turn, can result in
an improved ability to withstand unexpected market ﬂuc-
tuations and enhance prediction resilience [51]. This
observation is substantiated by prior research conducted
across various applications.
The fusion of these data modalities is achieved through
a speciﬁc process involving a concatenation layer and a
series of dense layers.
The temporal granularity of data processed by the dif-
ferent model branches is aligned. For each day, the LSTM
model processes a single multivariate data instance con-
taining stock prices and technical indicators. Likewise, the
FinBERT model leverages the most representative news
headline of the day (as explained in the previous subsec-
tion). Since the downstream task of interest is next-day
stock trend prediction, a daily time granularity is appro-
priate, and it allows us to train models efﬁciently

considering a large time frame. Both model branches
generate a vector embedding which is subsequently pro-
vided to the concatenation layer and results in the vertical
concatenation of the two vector embeddings.
More in detail, for FinBERT, the preprocessing phase
involves tokenizing the input text for BERT, adding special
tokens like [CLS] and [SEP]. The embeddings generated
by BERT offer contextual representations for each token,
capturing nuanced contextual relationships. These BERT
embeddings are then merged into the LSTM embeddings
by concatenating them with the input sequences, allowing
the multimodal model to leverage the rich contextual
information from both BERT and LSTM. Notably, the
conﬁguration of these layers is customized to suit the
dataset’s characteristics and the particular prediction task at
hand. This strategy for model architecture optimization was
proven to be beneﬁcial in [52]. Details of the architecture’s
optimization and tuning are shown in Table
3, which
contains information on the various hyperparameters and
conﬁgurations considered in the optimization process. We
conduct a tuning process leveraging AAPL, TSLA, and
MSFT stocks to identify an effective model architecture
conﬁguration (layers, number of neurons, etc.).
To this end, LSTM and FinBERT base models are
optimized independently, and are then combined in the
multimodal architecture, which is further optimized. For
hyperparameters used in this process, see Tables 1, 2, and
3, respectively. The selected values for the hyperparame-
ters optimization stage are motivated by works in the lit-
erature providing effective heuristics. Speciﬁcally, for
learning rate, the authors in [53] suggest to start from a
default value of 0.01 and experiment with a decreasing
factor (negative power of 10), where 106 is considered as
an extremely small value. Dropout and batch normalization
have been widely recognized as beneﬁcial as a regular-
ization technique to reduce overﬁtting in neural networks.
As for the dropout rate, works in [54] and [55] have shown
that values below 0.5 should be preferred, in order to avoid
the removal of too many neurons that would cause an
under-learning phenomenon. The number of LSTM and
dense layers, as well as the number of neurons in each
layer, also play an important factor, where multiple layers
generally allow the model to learn higher-level represen-
tations. Although their ideal value can be domain speciﬁc,
a restricted set of multiples of 2 (layers) and 20 (neurons)
are usually good candidates [56]. Models are optimized on
the training data (ﬁrst 75% of days), and the best-per-
forming architecture for base models and for the multi-
modal
branch
is
then
selected
to
conduct
actual
experiments with all stocks.
Our study’s priority is a diverse and comprehensive
evaluation of model performance. Considering that all data
modalities are required for evaluating the proposed multi-
modal model, we focus on two representative evaluation
periods: uptrend (June to December 2021) and downtrend
(January to September 2022), where this condition holds
(i.e., ﬁnancial news is unavailable before 2021). This
choice allows us to showcase and discuss model perfor-
mance in different market conditions. For each day in the
evaluation period, models are trained up to the previous
day, and predict the stock trend for the current day, leading
to a sliding window ﬁne-tuning and evaluation approach.
For the LSTM branch, the complete set of hyperparameters
optimized in our experiments is shown in Table 1. The
complete set of hyperparameters optimized for the Fin-
BERT branch is shown in Table 2. To this end, instead of
using grid search, we apply the Keras tuner to help us
select the best hyperparameter values. As for the multi-
modal fusion branch, the complete set of hyperparameters
is shown in Table 3.
Once the model combines the information from these
two data modalities and undergoes optimization, it is ready
to make predictions regarding the next-day trends in the
stock market. The model’s prediction is represented by a
single neuron with a sigmoid activation function, a com-
mon choice for binary classiﬁcation tasks. This neuron
outputs a value between 0 and 1, serving as an indicator of
the likelihood or probability of a speciﬁc stock’s next-day
trend. A value closer to 1 suggests a higher probability of a
positive trend, while a value closer to 0 indicates a higher
likelihood of a negative trend in the stock’s performance.
The dataset used in our work and the implementation of
the proposed approach are publicly available at the fol-
lowing online repository: https://github.com/rcorizzo/ﬁn
bert-lstm.
4 Experiments
In this section, we provide a description of the experi-
mental setup employed in our study. It encompasses the
conﬁguration of hyperparameters used for the various
models, and the evaluation metrics used in our evaluation.
Subsequently, we discuss the outcomes of our experiments
in relation to the accuracy achieved by the different mod-
els. Lastly, we focus our attention on portfolio analysis,
where we examine the consequences of utilizing model
predictions as triggers for buying and selling decisions in
real market scenarios.
4.1 Setup
In our experiments, we compare our results with popular
baselines. For baselines, suitable values for hyperparameter
tuning were chosen based on conﬁgurations reported as

ARIMA [57]: ARIMA, an abbreviation for autoregres-
sive
integrated
moving
average,
is
a
forecasting
approach characterized by three constituent compo-
nents, each of which is controlled by a speciﬁc
parameter. These components include the count of
autoregressive terms denoted as (p), the quantity of
nonseasonal differencing steps required to achieve
stationarity marked as (d), and the number of lagged
forecast errors integrated into the prediction equation
represented by (q). The comprehensive ARIMA model
can be formally expressed as follows:
y0
t ¼ c þ /1y0
t1 þ    þ /py0
tp þ h1et1 þ    þ hqetq þ et;
ð7Þ
where y0t represents a differenced time series, subject
to differencing operations multiple times. The predicted
values on the right-hand side encompass both past y0t
values and previous prediction errors. We use this
widely known autoregressive method to forecast the
closing price of each stock for the following day, using
historical price data. The key aspect of this approach is
to identify price trends by relying solely on the target
variable of interest. The prediction is then transformed
into a binary format, i.e., either an uptrend or a down-
trend, by comparing the predicted value (next day) with
the most recently observed closing price of the stock
(current day). To automatically determine the best
conﬁguration for the parameters (p, d, q) based on
historical training data, we use the Auto-ARIMA
implementation provided in ‘‘pmdarima.’’4
•
GBTs [58]: For all other parameters, we adhere to the
default conﬁguration recommended by the method’s
documentation in scikit-learn. gradient boosted trees
(GBTs) are a competitive ensemble method within
machine learning algorithms. In essence, GBTs blend
‘‘weak’’ machine learning models, such as decision
trees, into a more resilient and precise ensemble
machine learning model. The fundamental principle of
gradient boosting involves iteratively enhancing the
model’s predictions by training it to minimize the
residual error of previous base models. Concretely, an
incremental training strategy is employed, where one
tree is acquired in each iteration. For every individual
example, its prediction is generated by each model, and
the ﬁnal prediction is computed as the summation of the
scores provided by all models. To be more precise, the
objective function governing the optimization of tree
boosting can be formally expressed as follows:

where in l represents a differentiable convex loss
function quantifying the disparity between the predic-
tion, denoted as ^yi, and the target value, yi. Addition-
ally, X is used to impose a penalty on the model’s
complexity through a regularization term, which serves
the purpose of mitigating overﬁtting. Within our
methodology, this model is harnessed for the purpose of
identifying underlying patterns within the multi-di-
mensional feature space and uncovering nonlinear
associations among price data, statistical indicators, and
future price trends. Speciﬁcally, we adopt the imple-
mentation of Gradient Boosted Trees provided by sci-
kit-learn, accessible at the following.5 We proceed to
train the model using the ensuing hyperparameter
conﬁguration:

entropy loss. The base LSTM model considered con-
sists of two LSTM layers (500 and 100 units, respec-
tively), a dropout layer, and a dense layer with a single
neuron and sigmoid activation function to predict next-
day trends.
•
Polarity [41]: In this work, we utilize sentiment
analysis predictions acquired through the EODHD
Financial Data API.6 The sentiment analysis encom-
passes four distinct categories: polarity, negative,
neutral, and positive, with each score ranging from -1
to 1. Upon obtaining sentiment scores for all news
articles gathered about a speciﬁc stock on a given day,
we proceed to consolidate them and derive a binary
label serving as the global indicator for that stock on
that particular day. Speciﬁcally, if the cumulative
polarity score threshold is above 0.4, we assign the
label ‘‘1’’; otherwise, it is designated as ‘‘0.’’ The
underlying rationale for this binary classiﬁcation is
rooted in the idea that positive media coverage could
potentially signify an imminent uptrend. In contrast,
negative media coverage implies uncertainty and skep-
ticism, which may lead to a downtrend in the stock’s
performance.
•
Bi-LSTM [38]: The model is optimized via gradient
descent using the Adam optimizer and the binary cross-
entropy loss. The base LSTM model considered con-
sists of two LSTM layers (500 units). Following up, a
bidirectional LSTM layer with (128 units) and a
dropout rate of 0.8 is employed to enhance the model’s
ability to learn complex patterns bidirectionally, while
dropout
regularization
helps
mitigate
overﬁtting.
Finally, a dense layer with a single unit and sigmoid
activation is added to produce output predictions.
•
CNN Seq2Seq [42]: The model is a sequence-to-
sequence architecture for time series data. The encoder
starts with a 1D convolutional layer (128 ﬁlters, ReLU
activation), followed by max pooling. An LSTM layer
(128 units) captures temporal dependencies with 0.8
dropout regularization. A RepeatVector layer prepares
encoded representation. In the decoder, dilated convo-
lutional layers replace standard ones. A dilated convo-
lutional layer (128 ﬁlters, ReLU activation, dilation rate
2) followed by max pooling. An LSTM layer (128
units) decodes temporal information with a dropout rate
of 0.8. Finally, a time-distributed dense layer (single
unit, sigmoid activation) generates output predictions
for each time step.
•
Attention-CNN-LSTM [39]: The model architecture
includes an encoder–decoder structure for time series
data. The encoder starts with a 1D convolutional layer
(128 ﬁlters, ReLU activation) for feature extraction,
followed by max pooling. An LSTM layer (128 units)
captures temporal dependencies with 0.8 dropout reg-
ularization. An attention mechanism enhances perfor-
mance
by
focusing
on
relevant
information,
concatenated with encoder output for enriched repre-
sentation. The decoder includes a similar convolutional
layer, max pooling, and LSTM for decoding. Dropout
regularization is applied again. Finally, a time-dis-
tributed dense layer (sigmoid activation) generates
output predictions for each time step. This architecture
integrates convolutional and LSTM layers, dropout
regularization, and attention for effective time series

Dilated CNN Seq2Seq [40]: The adopted model is a
sequence-to-sequence architecture for time series data.
The encoder consists of a 1D convolutional layer with
128 ﬁlters and ReLU activation, followed by max
pooling. An LSTM layer with 128 units and dropout
rate of 0.8 captures temporal dependencies, and a
RepeatVector layer prepares the encoded representation
for each time step. In the decoder, dilated convolutional
layers replace standard convolutional layers. The ﬁrst
layer has 128 ﬁlters, ReLU activation, and a dilation
rate of 2 for broader contextual information. Max
pooling retains relevant features. An LSTM layer with
128 units decodes temporal information, with dropout
rate of 0.8. Finally, a time-distributed dense layer with a
single unit and sigmoid activation generates output
predictions for each time step.
•
CNN-LSTM [42]: CNNs are effective for learning
from time series data, with 1D convolutional layers
ﬁltering noise and extracting features. Causal convolu-
tion ensures inﬂuence only from previous time steps.
RNNs excel in sequential learning tasks. We compare
our model with CNN-LSTM, combining 1D CNN with
LSTM, featuring convolutional layer, LSTM, batch
normalization, dropout, and dense layer. Various model
variants explored for optimal parameters: hidden layers
(1 and 2), neurons (64 and 128), batch sizes (32 and 64),
and dropout rates (0.2 and 0.5). Best-performing CNN-

LSTM has a convolutional layer with 32 ﬁlters of size

•
GRU-CNN [37]: The GRU-CNN model combines
GRU and 1D CNN, offering simpler training and
improved performance. Parameters are similar to CNN-
LSTM. A key difference stands in the arrangement of
RNN and CNN layers. GRU-CNN is composed of a
GRU layer (128 units, tanh activation), a 1D convolu-
tional layer (32 ﬁlters, size 3, stride 1, causal padding,
ReLU activation), global max pooling, batch normal-
ization, dense layer (10 units, ReLU activation),
dropout (rate 0.2), and a dense layer (prediction window
size, ReLU activation). The GRU layer returns a
sequence, whereas global max pooling retains signiﬁ-
cant features and reduces dimensionality.
•
FinBERT-LSTM (Proposed): The best-performing
model architecture was obtained with two LSTM layers
with 500 and 450 hidden units, interleaved by a
normalization layer, followed by a batch normalization
layer, and a dense representation layer of size 72. The
best-performing FinBERT model following its standard
architecture was obtained with a normalization layer
followed by two dense layers of size 80 and 36, each of
which was interleaved by a normalization layer. The
best-performing architecture following to the fusion of
the two modalities was obtained with two dense layers
of size 40 and 60, interleaved by normalization layers.
For a quantitative evaluation of our results, we adopt
conventional classiﬁcation metrics such as Precision,
Recall (R), and F1-Score, deﬁned as:
Precision ¼
Tp
Tp þ Fp
;
Recall ¼
Tp
Tp þ Fn
;
F1  Score
¼ 2  Precision  Recall
Precision þ Recall ;
where Tp is the number of true positives, and Fp is the
number of false negatives. Speciﬁcally, we adopt micro-
averaged variants of Precision, Recall, and F-Measure, i.e.,
metrics are computed globally by considering each element
of the label indicator matrix as a label.
4.2 Model accuracy
In our analysis of different models’ performance on stock
trend prediction, we aim to provide a broad evaluation and
showcase model performance on a general set of real-world
stocks with great diversity. To this end, we employ data
from 12 real-world stocks in different sectors: Communi-
cation Services (ATVI, NFLX), Consumer Discretionary
(SBUX, TSLA), Information Technology (NVDA, AAPL),
Real Estate (AMT, PLD), Financials (NDAQ, SCHW),
Healthcare (JNJ, BIO). One relevant perspective for results
analysis is the model’s classiﬁcation accuracy on one-day-
ahead stock trend prediction. In the following, we describe
summarized results by ﬁnancial sector. A more ﬁne-
grained discussion is provided in the Appendix.
4.2.1 Communication services
For ATVI (Activision Blizzard), the best-performing
model in uptrend market conditions is Polarity with an F1-
Score of 0.63. In downtrend conditions, the proposed
model performs best with an F1-Score of 0.53. The worst-
performing models are GRU-CNN in downtrend (0.28) and

downtrends. For PLD (Prologis) ARIMA is the best model
for uptrends with an F1-Score of 0.59. For downtrends,
GRU-CNN performs best (0.60). The worst models are
Attention-CNN-LSTM (0.48) for uptrends and Polarity
(0.30) for downtrends.
4.2.5 Financials
For NDAQ (Nasdaq) ARIMA is the best for uptrends with
an F1-Score of 0.58. GBTs perform best for downtrends
(0.52). The worst model is Polarity (0.39 for uptrends and
0.36 for downtrends). For SCHW (Charles Schwab) GBTs
is the best model for uptrends with an F1-Score of 0.55. For
downtrends, GBTs lead with 0.53. The worst models are
CNN-LSTM (0.36) for uptrends and Attention-CNN-
LSTM, Bi-LSTM (0.37) for downtrends.
4.2.6 Health
For JNJ (Johnson & Johnson), the best uptrend model is
GBTs with an F1-Score of 0.56. ARIMA leads in down-
trend predictions with an F1-Score of 0.54. The worst
models are Polarity (0.49) for uptrends and GRU-CNN
(0.38) for downtrends. For BIO (Bio-Rad Laboratories), the
best-performing model for uptrends is GRU-CNN with an
F1-Score of 0.56. For downtrends, GRU-CNN again leads
with 0.56. The worst models are Attention-CNN-LSTM,
Polarity (0.40) for uptrends and Polarity (0.26= for
downtrends.
Analyzing the performance of different models for each
stock provides insights into their effectiveness in predicting
stock trends. Considering base models performance with
different stocks, GBTs emerge as the most robust approach
across all stocks, followed by LSTM, Polarity, and
ARIMA. We also observe that Polarity performs particu-
larly well in predicting TSLA stock trends, while LSTM

shows competitive performance in AAPL predictions.
However, experimental results in Tables 4, 5 and 6 show
that different models exhibit varying performance in cap-
turing uptrends and downtrends in stock prices.
In
uptrend
market
conditions,
GBTs
consistently
achieves the highest F1-Scores across multiple stocks,
indicating its effectiveness in capturing upward price
movements. ARIMA and Proposed also demonstrate a
competitive performance in predicting uptrends for certain
stocks.
However,
convolutional
neural
network-based
models such as CNN-LSTM and GRU-CNN consistently
underperform other approaches across various stocks and
market conditions.
In downtrend market conditions, however, the proposed
model
outperforms
other
models,
as
it
consistently
achieves the highest F1-Scores across various stocks,
showcasing strength in capturing downward price move-
ments. Overall, considering both uptrend and downtrend
predictions, the proposed model emerges as the top-per-
forming approach to capture the overall stock market trend.
It excels in predicting both upward and downward price
movements, representing a robust choice for stock trend
analysis. GBTs, ARIMA, Polarity, LSTM, BI-LSTM, CNN
Seq2Seq, Attention-CNN-LSTM, Dilated CNN Seq2Seq,
CNN-LSTM, and GRU-CNN can, in some cases, also
provide a competitive performance, although their level of
reliability signiﬁcantly varies across different stocks.
One possible explanation for the generally low perfor-
mance of CNN-based models is the noisy/highly ﬂuctuat-
ing nature of ﬁnancial data, as well as the lack of spatial
dependencies in the data, which makes CNN-based models
ineffective. On the other hand, models that focus on tem-
poral dependencies (LSTM, ARIMA), models that are
more robust to noise (GBTs), and models that consider a
holistic combination of data modalities (Proposed) appear
more effective in predicting stock trends. Another relevant
observation from a bias-variance perspective is that
ARIMA models are typically characterized by low vari-
ance, while GBTs are ﬂexible enough to capture complex
patterns without overﬁtting excessively, leading to more
accurate predictions than CNN-based models.
It is important to note that the performance of these
models may be inﬂuenced by changing macroeconomic
conditions and concept drift in the considered time frames.
The upward trajectory of stock prices in June 2021 can be
attributed to a conﬂuence of economic factors. Firstly, the
global economy was in a recovery phase after the severe
economic downturn triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Governments and central banks across the world had
implemented a series of monetary and ﬁscal policies to
stimulate economic growth, which boosted investor conﬁ-
dence. Secondly, companies began releasing favorable
earnings reports during this period. Positive ﬁnancial per-
formance exceeding market expectations can act as a cat-
alyst for stock price appreciation as it instills investor
optimism. Thirdly, the persistently low interest rates in
2021 made stocks an attractive investment option due to
the relatively higher potential returns when compared to
low-yield ﬁxed-income securities. Furthermore, sectors
such as technology and growth stocks exhibited consider-
able appeal to investors, with their higher growth potential
contributing to increased stock prices. Lastly, speculative
trading activities, epitomized by events like the GameStop
and AMC short squeezes, generated signiﬁcant retail
investor participation and volatility, inﬂuencing stock price
movements.
The decline in stock prices during 2022 can be attributed
to a combination of economic and market factors. First and
foremost, economic conditions, particularly the concerns
over rising inﬂation and interest rates, were central to the
reduced attractiveness of stocks. The expectation of
increasing inﬂation and interest rates led investors to con-
sider alternative investments that offered better protection
against eroding purchasing power and higher ﬁxed returns.
Secondly, geopolitical events, such as trade disputes and
international conﬂicts, introduced uncertainty into the
market, undermining investor sentiment. Geopolitical ten-
sions can result in market volatility, which has a detri-
mental impact on stock prices. Additionally, corporate
earnings played a pivotal role in driving down stock prices.
Companies reporting weaker-than-expected earnings, often
compounded by supply chain disruptions and increased
production costs, faced downward pressure on their stock
prices. Moreover, central bank policies, including potential
interest rate hikes, can lead to stock market declines, as
higher borrowing costs and reduced liquidity negatively
affect equity valuations. Finally, market sentiment, deter-
mined by factors like fear, uncertainty, and pessimism,
signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced stock market performance in 2022,
contributing to the overall decline in stock prices.

To validate the statistical signiﬁcance of our results, we
adopt Wilcoxon signed rank tests on all pairwise combi-
nations of methods across multiple executions, obtained
considering the average F1-Score with different stocks.
Based on results reported in Table 7, we can infer that in
downtrend market conditions, the proposed method out-
performs 9 out of 10 baselines in terms of F1-Score, and 6
of 10 comparisons are statistically signiﬁcant. In the single
case where one baseline (GBTs) outperform the proposed
method, this comparison is not statistically signiﬁcant (p-
value of 0.3556). In uptrend market conditions, the pro-
posed method outperforms 6 out of 10 baselines in terms of
F1-Score, and 3 of 6 comparisons are statistically signiﬁ-
cant. In the 4 other cases where baselines (ARIMA, LSTM,
GBTs, and Polarity) outperform the proposed method, all
cases are not statistically signiﬁcant (p-values: 0.7508,
0.0606, 0.0606, and 0.2366).
4.3 Portfolio analysis
In our experiments, we begin with a budget of 10,000 USD,
and allocate the entire amount to purchase as many shares
as possible at the prevailing market price on that day. The
parameter ‘‘Max Shares’’ with values of 1, 5, or 10 is used
to determine the number of stocks to be bought or sold each
day based on the trend predictions generated by various
models. When a model predicts a downtrend for the fol-
lowing day, we sell the desired number of shares at the
current market price to mitigate potential losses. This
action increases the available USD balance in the portfolio,
which can then be reinvested in purchasing additional
shares. On the other hand, if a model predicts an uptrend
and the available USD balance is positive, we utilize the
available balance to buy a number of shares that is either
equal to or less than the desired number.
In cases where a model predicts an uptrend, but there is
no available USD balance, we choose to hold onto all the
previously purchased shares. At the conclusion of the
simulation, all shares held in the portfolio are sold at their

respective market prices. The absolute value of the port-
folio in USD at this point is used to calculate the gains or
losses relative to the initial budget of 10,000 USD.
In our simulation, we do not consider trading fees as
some brokers, such as Charles Schwab,7 do not apply them
to online transactions and proﬁt from different revenue
streams. A custom trading fee can be easily considered
using our public code implementation8. In our experiments,
we perform two separate trading simulations in the two
time frames covered in our performance analysis: uptrend
(July 1, 2021 to Dec 31, 2021) and downtrend (Jan 1, 2022
to Sep 20, 2022). The ﬁndings of our portfolio analysis are
outlined in Tables 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18
and 19, while Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13
offer time series visualizations depicting the closing prices
of each stock over time, alongside the buy and sell signals
generated by all models. To maintain conciseness in our
discussion, we present the plot for the most effective
model, as determined by the portfolio results.
Examining the time series plots enables us to gain
valuable insights into the market conditions of the various
stocks on the overall time frame of our analysis (both
uptrend and downtrend). For ATVI, Fig. 2 reveals that the
stock started at $95, observed a downtrend up to the middle
of the evaluation time frame (with a bottom at $55), fol-
lowed by an uptrend up to $82:5, after which the price
retraced to about $75, which is lower than the ﬁrst day of
the evaluation. Moving to NFLX, Fig. 3 reveals that this
stock observed a signiﬁcant downtrend throughout the
entire evaluation time frame, starting with a value of over
$525 per share and ending up with $210. As for SBUX, a
similar uncertainty pattern can be observed in Fig. 4, with a
starting price of $112:5, a fast uptrend phase up to $126,
followed by a strong downtrend, which led to a bottom
price of $70, with a subsequent sideways phase. The stock
recouped its value in the ﬁnal uptrend phase, ending with a
value of $92, higher than the ﬁrst evaluation day. For
TSLA, Fig. 5 reveals that the stock started at $225 and
observed a sideways phase followed by an uptrend phase,
reaching a maximum price above $400. Subsequently, the
stock observed a retracement phase in the channel $300 
$375 followed by a downtrend with low peaks at $250 and
$200, recouping to $300 toward the end of the evaluation
time frame. In the case of NVDA (Fig. 6), the stock
exhibited an initial value of $200 and experienced an

uptrend, reaching a peak of $340 around the midpoint of
the evaluation period. Afterward, it encountered ﬂuctua-
tions and declined to $280 before recovering to $300,
which was higher than the value on the ﬁrst evaluation day.
Analyzing AAPL (Fig. 7), it displayed a substantial
uptrend throughout the entire evaluation duration, starting
at approximately $135 per share and concluding at $180.
Following this, there were ﬂuctuations leading to a dip to
$130, with a subsequent recovery to $150, which was
slightly higher than the value on the initial evaluation day.
Regarding AMT, a similar pattern of uncertainty was
observed (Fig. 8), with an initial price of $270, followed by
a rapid uptrend phase up to $305. However, this was fol-
lowed by a strong downtrend, resulting in a bottom price of
$230, leading to a subsequent sideways phase. Toward the
end of the evaluation period, the stock recovered its value
during the ﬁnal uptrend phase, ending with a value of $245,
higher than its value on the ﬁrst evaluation day. In the case
of PLD (Fig. 9), the stock displayed an initial value of
$120 and experienced an uptrend, reaching a peak of $172
around the midpoint of the evaluation period. Subse-
quently, it encountered ﬂuctuations and declined to $110
before recovering to $112, a lower value than that observed
on the ﬁrst evaluation day. In the case of NDAQ (Fig. 10),
the stock showed a signiﬁcant uptrend during the entire
evaluation period, commencing at around $58 per share
and reaching $73. However, there were ﬂuctuations that
caused a dip to $47:5, followed by a recovery to $61, a
value similar to that of the ﬁrst evaluation day. Examining
SCHW (Fig. 11), the stock initiated at $74 and underwent
an uptrend, peaking at $95 around the midpoint of the
evaluation period. Following this, there were ﬂuctuations
leading to a decline to $60 before recovering to $74, a
value similar to that on the ﬁrst evaluation day. Similarly,
JNJ exhibited a similar pattern of uncertainty (Fig. 12),
with an initial price of $165, followed by a rapid uptrend
phase up to $180. However, a signiﬁcant downtrend
ensued, resulting in a bottom price of $155, followed by a
subsequent sideways phase. Toward the end of the evalu-
ation period, the stock recovered its value during the ﬁnal
uptrend phase, ending with a value of $169, higher than its
value on the ﬁrst evaluation day. Lastly, examining BIO
(Fig. 13),
the
stock
displayed
a
signiﬁcant
uptrend
throughout
the
entire
evaluation
period,
starting
at
approximately $650 per share and ending at $825. How-
ever, there were ﬂuctuations that caused a dip to $710,

followed by a retracement to $450, a value signiﬁcantly
lower than its value on the ﬁrst evaluation day.
In analyzing model proﬁtability, the ﬁndings presented
in Tables 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19
indicate that the proposed multimodal approaches outper-
form the individual base models. This observation is par-
ticularly signiﬁcant as it demonstrates that the accuracy
rankings of different models, as discussed in the previous
section, may not necessarily align with their proﬁtability. A
notable example of this phenomenon is evident in the case
of AAPL (see Table 13), where the proposed model
achieves a lower F1-Score compared to the best-perform-
ing ARIMA base model (as seen in Table 4). Despite this,
the proposed model manages to achieve the largest gains,
averaging 13:49% in the downtrend time frame (see
Table 13), which is notably higher than the 9:75%
obtained with ARIMA.
The observed phenomenon can be explained by the
tendency of binary performance metrics, like F1-Scores, to
assign equal signiﬁcance to the accurate prediction of
trends across all days. However, these metrics may not
adequately address the ﬂuctuations in price changes
occurring within a 24-hour time frame. As a result, a model
that effectively predicts trends on days characterized by
signiﬁcant price volatility might identify advantageous
opportunities for buying and selling. Conversely, a model
that accurately forecasts trends for a larger number of days
when prices are relatively stable may not generate a
comparable level of proﬁtability. This underscores the
importance of incorporating additional considerations, such

as price variability, when evaluating the performance and
proﬁtability of models in the context of predicting stock
trends.
The superiority of the proposed multimodal approach is
also evident in its performance on uptrends in NFLX and
downtrends in NFLX, SBUX, TSLA, AAPL, NDAQ, and
BIO. It is worth noting that our model is particularly
conservative in a downtrend phase, resulting in better
capital preservation when compared with a buy-and-hold
strategy. In the following, we focus on signiﬁcant examples
where this phenomenon is observed.
For NFLX (see Table 9), the proposed multimodal
approach achieves an average gain of 19:42% in USD,
surpassing the second-ranked Polarity model’s perfor-
mance of 14:22% in uptrend market conditions. In the case
of SBUX (see Table 10), the proposed multimodal
approach achieves an average gain of 7:11% in USD in
downtrend market conditions, surpassing the second-
ranked Dilated CNN Seq2Seq model’s performance of
6:75%. In the case of TSLA (see Table 11), the proposed
model stands out in downtrend market conditions as the
only model with a positive average gain percentage,
exceeding CNN-LSTM, the second-best model in TSLA,
by an impressive 13:75% in USD. In the case of AAPL (see
Table 13), the proposed model emerges as the outper-
forming model demonstrating a favorable average gain
percentage. It outperforms the second-ranked model,
Dilated CNN Seq2Seq, in the AAPL context, by a
notable margin of 12:38% in USD. Similarly, in the case of
NDAQ (see Table 16), the proposed multimodal approach
achieves an average gain of 3:92% in USD, outperforming
the second-ranked Polarity, which obtains an average gain
of 1:36%. For the case of BIO (see Table 19), the proposed
multimodal approach achieves an average gain of 3:75%
in USD, outperforming the second-ranked Attention-CNN-
LSTM, which obtains an average gain of 4:44%.
In our analysis, it is noteworthy that in the uptrend time
frame, our proposed model outperforms the buy-and-hold
strategy with two stocks (ATVI, NFLX). Furthermore, our
model identiﬁes superior performance relative to the buy-
and-hold strategy for nine stocks (NFLX, SBUX, NVDA,
AAPL, PLD, NDAQ, SCHW, JNJ, and BIO), despite them
being in a downtrend.

## Page 28
From a theoretical viewpoint, the observed results reveal
that analyzing multiple perspectives (such as stock prices,
technical indicators, sentiment in news headlines) through
multimodal data fusion yields a model that requires
stronger evidence to predict changes in stock market
trends. On the contrary, other baseline models that are
mostly focused on temporal aspects of data, appear more
sensitive. This consideration explains why such baseline
models may have an advantage in an uptrend phase,
whereas our proposed model appears more conservative.
As a consequence, our multimodal fusion model presents a
more limited exposure in an uptrend phase, but can provide
better capital preservation capabilities than others in a
downtrend phase.
In general, the superior performance observed for the
proposed model can be attributed to its ability to integrate
diverse data sources, extract complex and high-level fea-
tures, capture nonlinear relationships, and learn in an end-
to-end manner, leading to reduced bias and improved
generalizability. These advantages enable the proposed
multimodal model to provide more accurate and robust
predictions compared to simpler models that might only
utilize a single type of data or simpler feature extraction
techniques.
Another interesting perspective is provided by analyzing
the impact of the ‘‘Max Shares’’ parameter in our experi-
ments. In the analysis of various stocks during both
uptrends and downtrends, several trends emerge, although
these patterns are not consistent across all cases. During
uptrends, there is a tendency for multiple stocks, such as
ATVI, NFLX, and SBUX, to perform better with a ‘‘Max
Shares’’ value set to 1, while AAPL, AMT, PLD, NDAQ,
JNJ, and BIO achieve best with a ‘‘Max Shares’’ value set
to 10.
However, during downtrends, the choice of ‘‘Max
Shares’’ value varies widely among different stocks, with
some favoring a value of 10 (e.g., ATVI, AAPL, SCHW)
and others performing better with a value of 1 (e.g., NFLX,
TSLA, NVDA, AMT, PLD, NDAQ, SCHW, JNJ, BIO).
The performance of speciﬁc models, including CNN-
LSTM, GRU-LSTM, LSTM, Polarity, ARIMA, and GBTs,
exhibits inconsistency, demonstrating their varied efﬁcacy

depending on the speciﬁc stock and market conditions.
These patterns suggest that the relationship between ‘‘Max
Shares’’ and model performance is stock-speciﬁc and
inﬂuenced by unique price behaviors, highlighting the need
for individualized analysis and tailored strategies for each
stock.
5 Conclusion
In this article, we propose a novel multimodal deep
learning method for ﬁnancial time series forecasting. The
primary challenge of next-day trend prediction in the
ﬁnancial sector with joint exploitation of text and time
series data is addressed by our method. To this end, our
model consists of a BERT-based model branch ﬁne-tuned
on ﬁnancial news, and a LSTM branch to capture useful
temporal patterns. Our extensive experiments using real-
world stock market datasets periods showed that our pro-
posed method is competitive with respect to popular
baselines,
in
both
uptrend
and
downtrend
market
conditions.
Our portfolio analysis showed that our method could be
fruitfully adopted in a trading scenario, yielding positive
gains in an uptrend phase, as well as capital preservation in
a downtrend phase, outperforming other baselines as well
as a buy-and-hold strategy. Possible limitations of our work
may include considering a single source for news headlines
and the non-exploitation of correlations between stocks for

study the exploitation of additional data modalities for
next-day trend stock market prediction. Moreover, we will
investigate the adoption of deep learning methods such as

Confusion matrices
It is important to note that relying solely on classiﬁcation
metrics may provide a limited perspective of the results. A
closer look at the confusion matrices for a selection of
stocks in communication services (ATVI-Fig. 14 and
NFLX-Fig. 15),
consumer
services
(SBUX-Fig. 16),
information technology (AAPL-Fig. 17), real estate (AMT-
Fig. 18), healthcare (JNJ-Fig. 19) reveals the diversity of
model predictions with uptrend (top) and downtrend
(bottom).
Taking ATVI as an example (see Fig. 14) we observe
that correct predictions for days of uptrend and downtrend
(as shown by the number of true negatives—TN and true
positives—TP, respectively) are rather balanced for some
of the models in uptrend, such as ARIMA (24, 30), LSTM
(36, 34), GBTs (33, 27), Polarity (42, 34) and imbalanced
for others, such as Bi-LSTM (37, 18), CNN-LSTM (34,
16), CNN Seq2Seq (30, 19), GRU-CNN (41, 10), Dilated
CNN Seq2Seq (40, 11), and Attention-CNN-LSTM (34,
15). In downtrend, we observe that some models are rela-
tively imbalanced, like LSTM (54, 30), GBTs (60, 36),
Polarity (29, 55), and ARIMA (61, 29), and the proposed
multimodal model (74, 21), while others are extremely
imbalanced, like Bi-LSTM (88, 9), CNN-LSTM (92, 5),
CNN Seq2Seq (96, 1), GRU-CNN (5, 64), Dilated CNN
Seq2Seq (90, 5), and Attention-CNN-LSTM (90, 6).
Shifting the focus to NFLX, GBTs presents the most
balanced performance in terms of correctly predicted days
of the uptrend (27–38), followed by LSTM (21–41) and
ARIMA (19–31). Results for the other models are other-
wise quite imbalanced. In downtrend, in decreasing order
of imbalance we can ﬁnd CNN Seq2Seq (91, 0), together
with Dilated CNN Seq2Seq (90, 0) and attention-CNN-
LSTM (93, 0), followed by CNN-LSTM (92, 5), Bi-LSTM
(81, 9), GRU-CNN (17, 64), our multimodal approach
(77–15), LSTM (49–27), and Polarity (30–53), GBTs
(54–32), and ARIMA (45–42), which presents the most
balanced performance.
Overall, some of the models show imbalance in their
predictions, as observed with the proposed multimodal
approach in uptrend for AAPL, and with ARIMA in

uptrend for JNJ, as well as for the majority of the stocks
with the Polarity approach in both uptrend and downtrend
(AMT, PLD, NVDA, NDAQ, SCHW, JNJ, and BIO).
Furthermore, it is noteworthy that a majority of stocks
analyzed using Bi-LSTM, CNN-LSTM, CNN Seq2Seq,
GRU-CNN, Dilated CNN Seq2Seq, and Attention-CNN-
LSTM methodologies exhibit imbalances in both uptrends
and downtrends. Speciﬁcally, stocks such as NFLX,
NVDA, AAPL, AMT, PLD, NDAQ, SCHW, and BIO
demonstrate imbalances during uptrends, whereas ATVI,
NFLX, AAPL, PLD, NDAQ, SCHW, JNJ, and BIO display
imbalances during downtrends.
Portfolio analysis: impact of max shares
In the context of an upward trend in the stock price of
ATVI, it is observed that all models exhibit superior per-
formance when ‘‘Max Shares’’ is set to 1. In contrast,
during a downward trend in ATVI, the models ARIMA,
CNN-LSTM,
GRU-CNN,
LSTM,
Polarity,
Attention-
CNN-LSTM,
and
the
Proposed
model
demonstrate
enhanced performance when ‘‘Max Shares’’ is set to 10,
while Dilated CNN Seq2Seq, GBTs, Bi-LSTM, and CNN
Seq2Seq yield similar results at a ‘‘Max Shares’’ value of 1
(see Table 8). For the stock price of NFLX in an uptrend,
the models CNN-LSTM, Dilated CNN Seq2Seq, GBTs,
GRU-CNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, Polarity, Attention-CNN-
LSTM, and CNN Seq2Seq are found to perform better with
a ‘‘Max Shares’’ value of 1, while ARIMA excels with a
‘‘Max Shares’’ value of 10, and the Proposed model per-
forms best at 5. Conversely, during a downtrend in NFLX,
only the ARIMA model performs better with a ‘‘Max
Shares’’ value of 10 (although even in this best case it
incurs in catastrophic losses of 40:48%), whereas all
other models perform best with a ‘‘Max Shares’’ value of 1
(see Table 9). In the case of SBUX during an uptrend, the
models
CNN-LSTM,
Dilated
CNN
Seq2Seq,
GBTs,
LSTM, Polarity, and CNN Seq2Seq exhibit a better per-
formance with a ‘‘Max Shares’’ value of 1, while ARIMA,
GRU-CNN, Bi-LSTM, Attention-CNN-LSTM, and the
Proposed models perform best with a ‘‘Max Shares’’ value
of 10. In a downtrend for SBUX, the Dilated CNN Seq2-
Seq, GBTs, LSTM, and CNN Seq2Seq models outperform
with a ‘‘Max Shares’’ value of 10, while ARIMA, CNN-
LSTM, GRU-CNN, Bi-LSTM, and Polarity yield better
results with a ‘‘Max Shares’’ value of 1, and the Proposed
and Attention-CNN-LSTM models excel at a ‘‘Max
Shares’’ value of 5 (see Table 10). For the TSLA stock in
an uptrend, the Dilated CNN Seq2Seq, LSTM, Bi-LSTM,
Polarity, Attention-CNN-LSTM, and the Proposed models
are found to perform better when the ‘‘Max Shares’’ value
is set to 5, while ARIMA, CNN-LSTM, GBTs, GRU-CNN,
and CNN Seq2Seq yield superior results at a ‘‘Max Shares’’
value of 10. During a TSLA downtrend, models like
ARIMA, CNN-LSTM, Dilated CNN Seq2Seq, GRU-CNN,
LSTM, Attention-CNN-LSTM, and CNN Seq2Seq excel
with a ‘‘Max Shares’’ value of 1, while Bi-LSTM and
Polarity perform best with a ‘‘Max Shares’’ value of 10,
and GBTs and the Proposed model provide the highest
performance at a ‘‘Max Shares’’ value of 5 (see Table 11).
In the context of an uptrend for NVDA, models such as
ARIMA, GBTs, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, Attention-CNN-LSTM,
and Proposed exhibit superior performance when the ‘‘Max
Shares’’ value is set to 10, whereas CNN-LSTM, GRU-
CNN, Polarity, and CNN Seq2Seq provide the highest
performance at a ‘‘Max Shares’’ value of 5, and Dilated
CNN Seq2Seq perform best at a ‘‘Max Shares’’ value of 1.
During a downtrend in NVDA, all models perform best
with a ‘‘Max Shares’’ value of 1 (see Table 12). In the case

of AAPL during an uptrend, only the GBTs model per-
forms better with a ‘‘Max Shares’’ value of 5, while the
other models perform best at a ‘‘Max Shares’’ value of 10.
In a downtrend for AAPL, we observe that CNN-LSTM,
Dilated CNN Seq2Seq, LSTM, Attention-CNN-LSTM,
CNN Seq2Seq, and Proposed models exhibit superior
performance at a ‘‘Max Shares’’ value of 10, and Bi-LSTM
performs best at 5, while the rest of the models perform
best with a ‘‘Max Shares’’ value of 1 (see Table 13). For
AMT in an uptrend, the LSTM, ARIMA, and Bi-LSTM
models perform better with a ‘‘Max Shares’’ value of 1,
while the rest of the models perform best with a ‘‘Max
Shares’’ value of 10. In a downtrend for AMT, all models
perform best at a ‘‘Max Shares’’ value of 1 (see Table 14).
During an uptrend in PLD, the GRU-CNN, LSTM, and Bi-
LSTM models exhibit a superior performance with a ‘‘Max
Shares’’ value of 5, while the rest obtain the best perfor-
mance at a ‘‘Max Shares’’ value of 10. In a PLD down-
trend, all of the models perform best at a ‘‘Max Shares’’
value of 1 (see Table 15). In the context of an uptrend in
NDAQ, it can be observed that the CNN-LSTM, Dilated
CNN Seq2Seq, and CNN Seq2Seq models perform best
with ‘‘Max Shares’’ equal to 5, while the rest of the models
present a better performance with a ‘‘Max Shares’’ value of
10. During a downtrend in NDAQ, only ARIMA and the
Proposed model exhibit superior performance with a ‘‘Max
Shares’’ value of 5, while the rest perform best at a ‘‘Max
Shares’’ value of 1 (see Table 16). For SCHW in an
uptrend, most of the models perform better with a ‘‘Max
Shares’’ value of 10, while Dilated CNN Seq2Seq, Bi-
LSTM, Attention-CNN-LSTM, CNN Seq2Seq performs
best at 5, and GRU-CNN obtains the best result at a ‘‘Max
Shares’’ value of 1. In a SCHW downtrend, only Dilated
CNN Seq2Seq, GBTs, Bi-LSTM, and Attention-CNN-
LSTM demonstrate superior performance with a ‘‘Max
Shares’’ value of 10, while the rest yield the highest per-
formance at a ‘‘Max Shares’’ value of 1 (see Table 17).
During an upward trend in JNJ, the LSTM and Polarity
models demonstrate optimal performance when the ‘‘Max
Shares’’ parameter is set to 1. Conversely, the CNN-LSTM,
Dilated CNN Seq2Seq, and CNN Seq2Seq models achieve
their peak performance at a ‘‘Max Shares’’ value of 5. As
for the ARIMA, GBTs, GRU-CNN, Bi-LSTM, Attention-
CNN-LSTM, and Proposed models, they yield the best
results when ‘‘Max Shares’’ is adjusted to 10. In a down-
trend scenario for JNJ, only Polarity and the Proposed
model exhibit superior performance when the ‘‘Max
Shares’’ value is set to 5. Conversely, the other models
perform optimally when ‘‘Max Shares’’ is set to 1. (see
Table 18). In the scenario of BIO during an upward trend,
both the LSTM and ARIMA models exhibit superior per-
formance when the ‘‘Max Shares’’ parameter is set to 1.
Conversely, Polarity and the Proposed model deliver
optimal outcomes when ‘‘Max Shares’’ is adjusted to 10,
whereas GBTs show the highest effectiveness with a ‘‘Max
Shares’’ setting of 5. When facing a BIO downtrend, GBTs
and the GRU-CNN showcase enhanced performance with a
‘‘Max Shares’’ value of 10, while the Proposed model
demonstrates superior results at a ‘‘Max Shares’’ value of 5.
Meanwhile, the remaining models demonstrate their best
performance when ‘‘Max Shares’’ is set to 1. (see
Table 19).
